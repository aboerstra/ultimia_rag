Maxim Roadmap final Transcript
00:01 - Adrian Boerstra: Everything is above the task level.
00:05 - Adrian Boerstra: And it's not really designed or intended to be at the task level.
00:12 - Adrian Boerstra: But it will link to Asana.
00:15 - Laura Dolphin: Okay, so I was just going to ask, is it pulling the projects and the
milestones from Asana?
00:20 - Laura Dolphin: Nope.
00:21 - Adrian Boerstra: It's, well, yes and no.
00:24 - Adrian Boerstra: The rocks are, this is meant to be a planning tool where I can just
go ahead and like, we can sit with Michael like this week and go, okay, for application intake,
rocks and the rocks are not like, these are not technical deliverables.
00:41 - Adrian Boerstra: I mean, technically it could be, but that's not the idea.
00:44 - Adrian Boerstra: The idea of a rock is, if you think about, and I haven't incorporated
the metrics or score, scorecard into this, but I was actually thinking about doing that.
00:52 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
00:54 - Adrian Boerstra: So the idea is, okay, let's talk application intake?
00:56 - Adrian Boerstra: Where your application and intake leader?
01:00 - Adrian Boerstra: We look over your metrics and we're seeing that one of the things
that we're measuring, we're just not doing well with time and time again.
01:09 - Adrian Boerstra: And you're feeling like you're hitting your head against the wall.
01:13 - Adrian Boerstra: What is our rock?
01:14 - Adrian Boerstra: What needs to change?
01:16 - Adrian Boerstra: And what is the thing that if we can get that done this quarter, it will
at least help to move the needle a little bit on application intake metrics, right?
01:26 - Adrian Boerstra: So how do we support what we're trying to get done?
01:30 - Adrian Boerstra: And then, so you might say, okay, well, we have to have at least our
beta test going on the Ai-based application intake.
01:38 - Adrian Boerstra: Now, in this case, that's sort of a technical milestone.
01:41 - Adrian Boerstra: So that might be real, because it does hit the business.
01:44 - Adrian Boerstra: Or it might be, well, my rock for this quarter is I want to average
three weeks in a row, want to make sure that we average less than 30 minutes for having
approvals or denials on every application.
02:02 - Adrian Boerstra: So, you would just write that in here and say, okay, so we want to
have a credit decision within an
02:17 - Adrian Boerstra: average time of less than 30 minutes.
02:22 - Adrian Boerstra: There, there's a rock.
02:24 - Adrian Boerstra: That means that we're going to achieve that by the end of Q3.
02:29 - Adrian Boerstra: Maybe I go three weeks in a row.
02:35 - Adrian Boerstra: So now when we meet every week, I click on add and there it is in
the in that quarter.
02:41 - Laura Dolphin: Okay.
02:42 - Adrian Boerstra: All right.
02:43 - Adrian Boerstra: So now we have one rock for this value stream.
02:46 - Adrian Boerstra: Now the milestones are our projects and what happens is as we
go into portfolio view and look into a project, But you have milestones that you can enter in
down here.
03:01 - Laura Dolphin: Are those pulling from Asana?
03:03 - Adrian Boerstra: They're not, but they kind of are.
03:06 - Adrian Boerstra: I can do an import.
03:07 - Adrian Boerstra: I can export from Asana a Json, and I can import that Json here,
and it will build this out for me.
03:14 - Laura Dolphin: Ok.
03:15 - Adrian Boerstra: So there's an export that we can do.
03:19 - Adrian Boerstra: So if you go up to here to Files, Import from Asana.
03:23 - Laura Dolphin: Ok.
03:24 - Adrian Boerstra: All right, so you can plan this all in Asana, and then bring it in.
03:27 - Adrian Boerstra: At the moment, it's just pulling in the tasks, or pulling in these
projects from Asana.
03:35 - Adrian Boerstra: And I don't have it so it's creating those milestones automatically.
03:39 - Adrian Boerstra: And right now, it's just creating them all as tasks and projects.
03:43 - Adrian Boerstra: So I'm going to have to just make it so it recognizes the milestones
better so that they come up here as milestones.
03:49 - Adrian Boerstra: So then the milestone will show up here as a milestone diamond
thing on our chart.
03:55 - Adrian Boerstra: So, as we bring in projects and milestones related to them, those
milestones then automatically will just show up for that value stream in that quarter under
your rocks.
04:08 - Adrian Boerstra: So that you can see, okay, as I set up these rocks, what are the
milestones that we're going to hit with these projects within that quarter?
04:18 - Adrian Boerstra: So, it just gives you a view of going, are they aligned, and do we have
the right things planned out?
04:24 - Laura Dolphin: Ok, so Ok, so here's what I need by Thursday.
04:30 - Laura Dolphin: So on Thursday, just so that you're aware, wants to under he wants
to know when we can have completed.
04:41 - Laura Dolphin: So your whole scrolly thing, like what you were wanting yesterday, we
can scroll and say, well, if you spend this much more money, you can have it done versus if
you don't.
04:49 - Laura Dolphin: So he wants to know when we will have his core goals for this year
done, and that is merging Brntl and the new scoring models.
05:06 - Adrian Boerstra: Okay, cool.
05:07 - Laura Dolphin: Those are his big ones.
05:09 - Adrian Boerstra: I've already put, the dates aren't all right, but this is basically a work
pad.
05:14 - Adrian Boerstra: So I can go, I can drag things around.
05:20 - Adrian Boerstra: There's a little bit of a bug.
05:21 - Adrian Boerstra: I can drag it around if I can see both sides of it.
05:25 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
05:25 - Adrian Boerstra: I have to go to the year view, and I can start this in April.
05:30 - Adrian Boerstra: There.
05:31 - Adrian Boerstra: And then now I can move that around.
05:33 - Laura Dolphin: Cool.
05:33 - Adrian Boerstra: Otherwise, you're just dragging one side of it.
05:37 - Adrian Boerstra: So, just so you know.
05:39 - Adrian Boerstra: But now we have a view of everything and I can just like move this
around and go, okay, well, we have June to get that done.
05:45 - Adrian Boerstra: So, there it is in June.
05:47 - Adrian Boerstra: I got July to get this done.
05:51 - Adrian Boerstra: That's how it overlaps with that.
05:53 - Adrian Boerstra: Well, let's push that out to you.
05:55 - Adrian Boerstra: So, you can plan this all out.
05:57 - Adrian Boerstra: And as you do that, if we have, So you can do resource allocation
on the project.
06:03 - Adrian Boerstra: And if you put this stuff in, like we need one senior consultant, we
have one allocated, and this is going to be for this project.
06:11 - Adrian Boerstra: We're gonna need 80 hours.
06:13 - Laura Dolphin: I also don't want him, I don't wanna even have really a conversation
with him about people and resources, okay?
06:22 - Laura Dolphin: I wanna like, I feel like he's gonna get stuck on that.
06:25 - Laura Dolphin: And I don't want that.
06:27 - Laura Dolphin: Like, I don't, for him, he just needs to know it's gonna take 150 hours
and then I will work out who does that.
06:35 - Laura Dolphin: I don't want to go into that at all.
06:37 - Laura Dolphin: I don't even want to show it to him.
06:38 - Laura Dolphin: Like, I don't care if he looks at this, but I don't want him to know of
that.
06:43 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah, I don't want to go there at all.
06:45 - Laura Dolphin: So I'll just be like, yeah.
06:46 - Adrian Boerstra: That's fine.
06:46 - Adrian Boerstra: So on this page, it doesn't care about who's who.
06:50 - Adrian Boerstra: All it does is it adds up.
06:54 - Adrian Boerstra: So if we do a future state contract of 160 hours, like if I bring this
down to 30 hours a month, then right now with what we have entered in here, because I
haven't put hours into everything, the required hours are only 20 hours per month.
07:11 - Adrian Boerstra: So this shows that we're under by 20 hours.
07:14 - Adrian Boerstra: But if I go in here and go, okay, we're gonna need 80 hours for this
project from a senior consultant
07:24 - Adrian Boerstra: see the average.
07:25 - Adrian Boerstra: What it's doing is looking at everything that I have and calculating
out based on the current view, what the month, it just averages out how many hours a month
it is.
07:35 - Adrian Boerstra: And then says, hey, are we over or under?
07:39 - Adrian Boerstra: And that gives us the ability to immediately go, oh, well, here.
07:43 - Adrian Boerstra: So the idea is you'd wanna plan everything out based on when he
wants to get things done.
07:50 - Adrian Boerstra: and then look at this.
07:54 - Adrian Boerstra: Otherwise you're gonna be constantly pushing things out, stretching
things out in order to make sure that we're staying within 30 hours.
08:01 - Adrian Boerstra: But the point here is let's get this done as quick as possible, but have
good visibility on how it's gonna take.
08:07 - Laura Dolphin: I love that.
08:08 - Adrian Boerstra: So this is the worksheet to help you to just figure all this stuff out.
08:12 - Laura Dolphin: This makes me want a happy cry, Adrian.
08:14 - Laura Dolphin: I love this.
08:16 - Adrian Boerstra: Oh, good, good.
08:19 - Laura Dolphin: I'm fuzzies inside.
08:21 - Adrian Boerstra: I'm really glad.
08:23 - Adrian Boerstra: So it's just a conversation piece, right?
08:27 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah, I love it.
08:28 - Laura Dolphin: Can we do a couple of things just so that I can familiarize myself a
little bit with this, and then I can always run with it?
08:34 - Laura Dolphin: I see it's on local host, though.
08:35 - Laura Dolphin: I don't know if it's going to be something where I'm going to.
08:37 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah, I'm working on getting it on a hosted page.
08:41 - Adrian Boerstra: But just remember, if he goes into it, he's not going to see whatever
you put unless you give him, unless you export the Json and he imports it because there's
no database behind it.
08:53 - Adrian Boerstra: It's just like cache browser storage.
08:56 - Laura Dolphin: I don't even want him to, I don't think he needs access to it in all
honesty.
09:01 - Adrian Boerstra: We can just use it as a tool for our meetings.
09:03 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah and I feel like if he ever wants like a visual it's literally just like
screenshot or like export and Pdf kind of thing.
09:12 - Laura Dolphin: That's all that he would ever need.
09:13 - Laura Dolphin: I don't, he gets confused in those details anyways.
09:16 - Laura Dolphin: Like this is where we need to just say like, it's gonna be 150 hours.
09:20 - Laura Dolphin: It'll be done by end of August.
09:22 - Laura Dolphin: Do you need any more information?
09:26 - Adrian Boerstra: So we can save scenarios as well.
09:29 - Adrian Boerstra: There's default, there's maximum back to where it was, you know,
just a second ago.
09:35 - Adrian Boerstra: But just remember these scenarios are just saved locally in your
browser cache.
09:39 - Adrian Boerstra: it's not on the back end.
09:41 - Adrian Boerstra: So if you open it from a different computer, you won't see those
scenarios.
09:45 - Adrian Boerstra: You'd have to export the Json and import it in to reload the same
settings.
09:51 - Laura Dolphin: Oh, okay.
09:52 - Laura Dolphin: So if you exported it and I imported it, I could essentially- Then you
can see, yeah, then you can pick up where we left off.
09:59 - Laura Dolphin: Cool.
09:59 - Laura Dolphin: Okay.
10:01 - Laura Dolphin: Okay, so let me talk through a couple of things and then you can kind
of guide me and then I can even just take it on my own.
10:08 - Laura Dolphin: So.
10:09 - Laura Dolphin: Okay
10:12 - Laura Dolphin: so actually, can you show me how to do this?
10:16 - Laura Dolphin: For May, April and May, we delivered quite a, like, so you remember
how I was talking about the original roadmap from, like, back a couple years ago?
10:28 - Laura Dolphin: We actually have delivered quite a few of those.
10:31 - Laura Dolphin: Okay.
10:32 - Laura Dolphin: Or pretty fundamental, like roadmap items and I want to show that
to him as well.
10:37 - Adrian Boerstra: Let me pass the baton to you.
10:40 - Laura Dolphin: Okay.
10:41 - Adrian Boerstra: And I'll let you control it, but I kind of want to see what you do
naturally to do things.
10:46 - Adrian Boerstra: I tried to make it very intuitive.
10:48 - Laura Dolphin: Okay.
10:50 - Adrian Boerstra: If I can, can you request?
10:55 - Laura Dolphin: Yes, give me a sec.
10:55 - Laura Dolphin: I never remember how that's done.
10:57 - Adrian Boerstra: I think it's like, I'll give mouse keyboard control to Laura.
11:01 - Adrian Boerstra: There you go.
11:04 - Laura Dolphin: Click to start.
11:05 - Laura Dolphin: Okay.
11:07 - Laura Dolphin: Can you zoom in just one place on your browser?
11:11 - Laura Dolphin: Sure.
11:12 - Laura Dolphin: I don't know if I can do that.
11:14 - Adrian Boerstra: Actually, I'll just go up here.
11:18 - Adrian Boerstra: Oh yeah.
11:19 - Laura Dolphin: That's good.
11:20 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah, 100 is fine.
11:21 - Laura Dolphin: I'm just blind.
11:23 - Laura Dolphin: Okay, so I want to Give me a sec.
11:33 - Adrian Boerstra: If you double-click this, it opens up the edit.
11:37 - Laura Dolphin: Sorry, I'm just orienting myself.
11:39 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah, go for it.
11:40 - Laura Dolphin: Oh, cool.
11:41 - Laura Dolphin: Does that actually work?
11:42 - Adrian Boerstra: If you've imported the Json, yeah, this will work.
11:45 - Adrian Boerstra: It'll open up the same project in Asana.
11:47 - Laura Dolphin: Wait.
11:47 - Laura Dolphin: Okay.
11:48 - Laura Dolphin: I want to add in, are these projects here?
11:51 - Adrian Boerstra: Those are projects, yeah.
11:52 - Laura Dolphin: Okay.
11:52 - Laura Dolphin: If I add a project.
11:55 - Laura Dolphin: Okay, so.
12:00 - Adrian Boerstra: And I've made it so the projects you can drag the order around.
12:04 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah, and you can drag them between different value streams to.
12:08 - Laura Dolphin: Okay, so just let me know if anything that I'm actually documenting
as projects, you disagree with, but go for it.
12:15 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
12:16 - Laura Dolphin: Okay, so we got users over the lightning.
12:21 - Laura Dolphin: Value stream.
12:23 - Laura Dolphin: Ok, so this is technically like, I think it's this guy because it doesn't
really fit within.
12:27 - Adrian Boerstra: Or it could even be maintenance.
12:30 - Adrian Boerstra: It's probably something that doesn't necessarily add direct value.
12:35 - Laura Dolphin: True.
12:35 - Laura Dolphin: Ok, so we started this.
12:40 - Laura Dolphin: I'll just put March, even though it was earlier than that.
12:45 - Laura Dolphin: And I'll say end of April.
12:48 - Laura Dolphin: Actually, no, it was like here.
12:52 - Laura Dolphin: It was here.
12:55 - Laura Dolphin: And then, oh, god, how did I?
13:00 - Laura Dolphin: I'm assuming we want hours, right?
13:03 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah, I mean, definitely it helps for some of the answers you'd look
to get from it.
13:09 - Adrian Boerstra: It's not required, but.
13:11 - Laura Dolphin: No, that's Ok.
13:12 - Laura Dolphin: Um
13:19 - Laura Dolphin: I'm going to just put 40.
13:21 - Laura Dolphin: Okay, I'll put 50 actually, because there was like some in there, but I
put one.
13:27 - Adrian Boerstra: There and one on the allocated.
13:30 - Laura Dolphin: That's there you go.
13:32 - Laura Dolphin: Okay.
13:35 - Adrian Boerstra: And I actually haven't been playing with the priority, but maybe that
was probably a high priority project.
13:42 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah, I guess it wasn't even really a project.
13:44 - Adrian Boerstra: You have these color badges for.
13:50 - Laura Dolphin: Cool
13:59 - Laura Dolphin: so then how do you show, hang on, I want to show complete.
14:04 - Laura Dolphin: status completed.
14:06 - Laura Dolphin: This was high.
14:10 - Laura Dolphin: That's play.
14:16 - Laura Dolphin: Is this like a refresh?
14:17 - Adrian Boerstra: There is a little, what was that?
14:19 - Laura Dolphin: Is this a refresh to show the completed?
14:25 - Adrian Boerstra: Oh, that's interesting that it's not, that's a bug.
14:30 - Laura Dolphin: it can I refresh?
14:32 - Adrian Boerstra: Oh no, you know what it is?
14:33 - Adrian Boerstra: I think that percentage is calculated off of if you had uh let me just
find out.
14:43 - Laura Dolphin: Okay.
14:43 - Adrian Boerstra: We're gonna take a look at the logic.
14:45 - Adrian Boerstra: Oh yeah I'll look at it after.
14:48 - Laura Dolphin: Okay um okay so there's that one.
14:51 - Laura Dolphin: And then what else do we do?
14:53 - Laura Dolphin: Um Aio went live in May.
15:00 - Laura Dolphin: I'm sorry I've like stuck.
15:04 - Laura Dolphin: Okay so here.
15:12 - Laura Dolphin: Um Aio
15:24 - Adrian Boerstra: I'm happy about this because I can use this for any kind of strategic
customer.
15:29 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah.
15:31 - Laura Dolphin: I'm going to put this was this was a long one.
15:33 - Laura Dolphin: Oops.
15:35 - Laura Dolphin: That's not what I wanted.
15:37 - Laura Dolphin: When did we go?
15:39 - Laura Dolphin: Go around here.
15:43 - Laura Dolphin: David.
15:43 - Adrian Boerstra: I actually find it easier to put in random dates on this.
15:48 - Adrian Boerstra: Drag the bar because it adjusts the dates automatically from the
chart view.
15:54 - Laura Dolphin: Okay, so I'll put, I always get these two confused, which one it is.
15:59 - Laura Dolphin: Docs, it's docs.
16:01 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah, we have the Ai stuff as part of documentation.
16:09 - Laura Dolphin: Okay.
16:15 - Laura Dolphin: So yeah, if these could like show completed, that would be cool.
16:19 - Adrian Boerstra: So they show complete where they show completed is the little icon
beside the project name.
16:25 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah, that's right now.
16:28 - Adrian Boerstra: So the percentage I'll fix the percentage.
16:31 - Laura Dolphin: Okay.
16:32 - Laura Dolphin: Okay, cool.
16:33 - Laura Dolphin: So there's that one.
16:35 - Adrian Boerstra: What else we do we got like, I think the percentage is based on
something that doesn't exist yet, which is how many hours does it take and how many hours
are we have we put against it.
16:45 - Adrian Boerstra: I think that's how it calculates the hours, but I haven't put anywhere
where you can actually input how many hours have been used to get that.
16:51 - Laura Dolphin: I gotcha.
16:52 - Laura Dolphin: Okay.
16:53 - Adrian Boerstra: And I'm not sure, what's your opinion?
16:55 - Adrian Boerstra: Do we need that?
16:56 - Adrian Boerstra: Like, in terms of like, do you want to be able to update and say, hey,
this is how many hours we've put in this project so far?
17:03 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
17:03 - Laura Dolphin: So what Michael wants is like, if we can give him a view of like, this
is a project, we estimate 150 hours and then it took 200.
17:11 - Laura Dolphin: That is like valuable information.
17:14 - Laura Dolphin: I don't need time logs or I don't need entries.
17:18 - Laura Dolphin: I just want one field that says estimate, like 150.
17:23 - Laura Dolphin: Hang on, one quick sec.
17:26 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah, just one field that says time spent, so that you can track it not
only along the way, but post-completion.
17:32 - Adrian Boerstra: One sec, Laura.
17:34 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
17:34 - Adrian Boerstra: Hey, Caleb.
17:37 - Adrian Boerstra: Good, good.
17:38 - Adrian Boerstra: Hey, give me my mouse here for a quick second, Laura.
17:41 - Laura Dolphin: Oh, yeah.
17:49 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah, I sorry I saw the I had, I had another meeting there at 10.
17:56 - Adrian Boerstra: Um, but I can meet in about a half hour.
18:05 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah, if you just want to move it to, uh, 1130, I'm good.
18:10 - Adrian Boerstra: Okay.
18:12 - Adrian Boerstra: Thanks.
18:14 - Adrian Boerstra: Okay, bye.
18:17 - Adrian Boerstra: All right, you got the mouse again.
18:19 - Laura Dolphin: Oh, okay.
18:23 - Laura Dolphin: Sent.
18:24 - Laura Dolphin: Okay.
18:27 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah, sorry, did you get that feedback that I gave?
18:31 - Adrian Boerstra: No.
18:32 - Laura Dolphin: Okay, yeah, so just around the completion, I don't need time entries,
but the ability to just put like time spent just like you can.
18:40 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah, yeah, and that will basically say like 20% complete, 50%
complete, 100% complete, but then show like if it was estimated 150 and then we spent
200 so that we can show over.
18:54 - Adrian Boerstra: Do you want to see some of that like we could do a mouse over like
when you hover over the bar?
19:02 - Laura Dolphin: Love it.
19:03 - Laura Dolphin: Yep.
19:03 - Laura Dolphin: Those are like, that's literally the key is like estimate time spent and
then like percentage.
19:09 - Adrian Boerstra: Can you put some of those notes in Slack for me?
19:12 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah, you bet.
19:14 - Laura Dolphin: Okay.
19:17 - Laura Dolphin: Do you want me to do that now or do I keep going?
19:20 - Adrian Boerstra: Whatever, as long as you'll remember it later.
19:22 - Laura Dolphin: I'll do it now.
19:23 - Adrian Boerstra: We've got Spiky.
19:24 - Adrian Boerstra: We actually have Spiky in.
19:25 - Laura Dolphin: So let's just.
19:26 - Laura Dolphin: Okay, okay, cool.
19:29 - Laura Dolphin: Okay, so, okay, so here's.
19:34 - Adrian Boerstra: I think it's crazy that I had to build this though.
19:37 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah, I know, but it's really cool.
19:39 - Laura Dolphin: But yeah, it shouldn't be that like, there are a lot of tools out there that
we could have used.
19:43 - Adrian Boerstra: I mean, probably if we had a Psa tool, it would have a lot of this in
it, but.
19:49 - Laura Dolphin: Well, don't we have Rocket Lane?
19:50 - Laura Dolphin: I'm sure Rocket Lane does exactly this.
19:56 - Laura Dolphin: That was good.
19:58 - Adrian Boerstra: That was rich.
19:59 - Laura Dolphin: Funny.
20:00 - Laura Dolphin: It's funny.
20:02 - Adrian Boerstra: All right.
20:04 - Laura Dolphin: Here's what else I've also done, which has not really been like Wahoo'd
over, but I have done a lot of cleanup.
20:12 - Laura Dolphin: This was like our phase two in our original map was like deleting
packages and objects and code and like rules and permissions.
20:20 - Laura Dolphin: It's not done, but I've been working on that and I have made tracks.
20:25 - Laura Dolphin: How would you recommend, is that one of those things where I can
literally just show like it's going to, it's going over the year, like it's going to take more time,
but that we're like, you know, 70% complete?
20:38 - Adrian Boerstra: I would break it up into multiple projects, probably.
20:43 - Adrian Boerstra: If it's going to carry over the year or something, briefly.
20:47 - Adrian Boerstra: I think we should try to make sure that a project doesn't go longer
than a quarter.
20:54 - Adrian Boerstra: And if it is, let's break it up into smaller, separate projects.
20:59 - Adrian Boerstra: So that milestones happen within a quarter, and projects don't span
more than a quarter.
21:06 - Laura Dolphin: I think that's good to show.
21:10 - Laura Dolphin: It's not business, like it's not really a milestone though.
21:14 - Laura Dolphin: The only really businessy crossover is the fact that I've reduced
Michael having to pay for things by doing more.
21:23 - Adrian Boerstra: That's an interesting one.
21:24 - Adrian Boerstra: So yeah, how do we show?
21:28 - Adrian Boerstra: So go to the Rocks page for a second.
21:39 - Adrian Boerstra: Um, it's the quarterly view, actually.
21:42 - Laura Dolphin: Oh, okay.
21:43 - Laura Dolphin: Thanks.
21:44 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah.
21:45 - Adrian Boerstra: So if you go, if you're on this view with which quarter was it in.
21:49 - Laura Dolphin: April, May, April, so okay.
21:52 - Adrian Boerstra: So let's show past orders.
21:54 - Adrian Boerstra: Oh, that'd be cute too.
21:55 - Laura Dolphin: You're right.
21:56 - Laura Dolphin: Okay.
21:57 - Adrian Boerstra: So for application, is it an application intake rock that it would have
been.
22:01 - Laura Dolphin: It's none of them.
22:02 - Laura Dolphin: It's literally just like Michael was going to get billed from Salesforce
for being over all of their custom objects.
22:07 - Adrian Boerstra: Oh, well, that's probably a maintenance thing then, I guess.
22:10 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
22:10 - Laura Dolphin: All of its maintenance, all of it is.
22:13 - Adrian Boerstra: Add in the, add in the, what the rock would have been, had we called
it out ahead of time.
22:18 - Laura Dolphin: Um, prevent.
22:25 - Laura Dolphin: Like prevent, um
22:37 - Laura Dolphin: Hang on, sorry, I'm still blind.
22:41 - Laura Dolphin: It's better.
22:44 - Laura Dolphin: How about that?
22:46 - Adrian Boerstra: Sure.
22:47 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah?
22:48 - Laura Dolphin: Okay.
22:49 - Adrian Boerstra: From Salesforce.
22:50 - Adrian Boerstra: It's got to be specific enough to, but yeah.
22:53 - Adrian Boerstra: And then click on add.
22:55 - Adrian Boerstra: So that adds that rock in.
22:57 - Adrian Boerstra: I got to change that font size.
22:59 - Adrian Boerstra: The font size is way too big on that.
23:03 - Adrian Boerstra: So that's completed.
23:04 - Adrian Boerstra: And now go back over to your portfolio view.
23:09 - Adrian Boerstra: And then add in the project.
23:14 - Adrian Boerstra: You have the project there already?
23:17 - Adrian Boerstra: So that's the value stream.
23:19 - Adrian Boerstra: But let's add the project for that.
23:22 - Adrian Boerstra: What did you do?
23:22 - Adrian Boerstra: What was the project around?
23:24 - Adrian Boerstra: Oh, you don't have to scroll up to the top to add a project.
23:28 - Adrian Boerstra: There's also a plus in the values.
23:29 - Laura Dolphin: Oh, Ok.
23:30 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah, I saw that.
23:31 - Laura Dolphin: I'm going to do that.
23:33 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah, that way, right from where you are.
23:36 - Adrian Boerstra: There you go.
23:37 - Laura Dolphin: So.
23:46 - Adrian Boerstra: There you go.
23:47 - Adrian Boerstra: And then add in a milestone for this.
23:51 - Adrian Boerstra: Let's
23:54 - Laura Dolphin: do by the 15th, add in a milestone.
23:58 - Adrian Boerstra: Yes, scroll all the way down.
23:59 - Laura Dolphin: Oh, okay.
24:01 - Adrian Boerstra: Now put in completed optimization of custom objects or fields or
whatever.
24:15 - Adrian Boerstra: And then status completed.
24:19 - Adrian Boerstra: And the data was completed.
24:23 - Adrian Boerstra: Cool.
24:24 - Adrian Boerstra: And then, oh, click the plus beside that.
24:27 - Adrian Boerstra: That's how you actually create it.
24:29 - Adrian Boerstra: And if you scroll down, you should see it now below.
24:32 - Adrian Boerstra: So you can add in multiple milestones on a project that way.
24:36 - Laura Dolphin: Assuming we need this.
24:38 - Laura Dolphin: What did I?
24:40 - Laura Dolphin: Maybe like eight?
24:42 - Adrian Boerstra: Ok.
24:42 - Adrian Boerstra: Project.
24:44 - Adrian Boerstra: Oh, and the project is completed as well.
24:48 - Laura Dolphin: Thank you.
24:52 - Adrian Boerstra: There you go.
24:54 - Adrian Boerstra: Very good.
24:55 - Adrian Boerstra: Now if you look at that quarterly view page and
25:01 - Adrian Boerstra: go back down to that, you'll see that milestone listed in there.
25:05 - Laura Dolphin: Ok.
25:09 - Adrian Boerstra: Oh, hang on.
25:10 - Adrian Boerstra: It didn't save the rock, did it?
25:13 - Laura Dolphin: No.
25:14 - Adrian Boerstra: Okay, jot that one down.
25:17 - Adrian Boerstra: The rocks aren't saving.
25:19 - Laura Dolphin: Oh, okay.
25:21 - Adrian Boerstra: Um, oh, the rocks might be saving, but they're not showing up.
25:28 - Adrian Boerstra: Uh, but I'll figure it out.
25:30 - Adrian Boerstra: It's one or the other.
25:31 - Laura Dolphin: Do you want me to try again?
25:32 - Adrian Boerstra: No, no, it's probably a bug because I haven't tested.
25:35 - Adrian Boerstra: This was like the last thing that I built out yesterday.
25:39 - Laura Dolphin: This also says two hours, but I think I put in eight.
25:43 - Laura Dolphin: I don't know if that matters.
25:48 - Adrian Boerstra: Oh, senior consultant, two hours.
25:51 - Adrian Boerstra: Interesting.
25:53 - Laura Dolphin: Let me just go back and make sure.
25:54 - Laura Dolphin: I'm pretty sure I put eight.
25:56 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah, I think I thought you did put eight, so.
26:09 - Adrian Boerstra: If you click the pencil, it'll go back into the data.
26:16 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah, so I don't know where the two is coming from.
26:18 - Adrian Boerstra: So yeah, note that bug.
26:21 - Laura Dolphin: Ok.
26:23 - Laura Dolphin: How come it doesn't show here March?
26:27 - Adrian Boerstra: Because it's before.
26:28 - Adrian Boerstra: You got to change your portfolio timeline to start month.
26:31 - Laura Dolphin: Ok.
26:33 - Adrian Boerstra: Or go to the year view.
26:39 - Adrian Boerstra: There you go.
26:40 - Adrian Boerstra: If you scroll down now, I'll show them.
26:44 - Laura Dolphin: Cool.
26:52 - Laura Dolphin: So then this is awesome.
26:55 - Laura Dolphin: I'm going to spend maybe the rest of the time just doing the data
model stuff.
27:02 - Adrian Boerstra: I need to make this so it's actually accessible to you.
27:05 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
27:06 - Adrian Boerstra: You're just obviously on my computer right now.
27:08 - Adrian Boerstra: I'll work on that right away so that you can keep it on with this.
27:16 - Laura Dolphin: Let me ask you this.
27:20 - Laura Dolphin: The data model refresh is basically like it's needed for merging Br and
Tl and getting their new scoring model in place.
27:36 - Laura Dolphin: But the project itself, like merging Br and Tl could essentially, actually
I'm kind of just talking and thinking out loud at the same time too.
27:47 - Laura Dolphin: I think I'd probably should split those so that he doesn't, Like, cause
what I've done are in Jira, um, is I've just put everything under data model refresh, but that's
like.
28:00 - Laura Dolphin: 152 hours.
28:01 - Laura Dolphin: And I feel like it will hit home a little bit more or like settle better if I
split those, because a lot of it is related to like Trnbl.
28:11 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
28:12 - Laura Dolphin: Don't be like all the documentation, like all Konga, the docusign, the
sales process, the sales stages, that is really their process and I should put that in the credit
underwriting because that's the big project there.
28:34 - Laura Dolphin: Then the scoring should probably go, actually it needs to go in there
as well.
28:40 - Laura Dolphin: So both of those are going to be in there.
28:41 - Adrian Boerstra: Try the drag behavior by the way.
28:44 - Laura Dolphin: Try the drag behavior.
28:45 - Adrian Boerstra: I dragged the project.
28:47 - Adrian Boerstra: See the little.
28:47 - Laura Dolphin: Oh, this guy?
28:48 - Laura Dolphin: Ok.
28:49 - Adrian Boerstra: Look at the handle to the left of the project name on the far left
column.
28:54 - Laura Dolphin: Oh, Ok.
28:55 - Laura Dolphin: There you go.
28:56 - Adrian Boerstra: You should be able to just click on one of those and drag it.
28:59 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
29:00 - Laura Dolphin: Ok.
29:01 - Laura Dolphin: No, it's doing all of them.
29:02 - Adrian Boerstra: Let me try it.
29:03 - Adrian Boerstra: I've tested this before.
29:10 - Adrian Boerstra: Oh, there we go.
29:10 - Adrian Boerstra: I
29:15 - Adrian Boerstra: think it was, I think it's just a zoom thing.
29:19 - Laura Dolphin: Okay.
29:19 - Laura Dolphin: So, I think I need to.
29:25 - Adrian Boerstra: I think we should actually take the ownership time tracking.
29:30 - Adrian Boerstra: Unless it's a really discreet effort within each area.
29:33 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
29:34 - Adrian Boerstra: I think we should just have one of them and just put it under like
product and program innovation, I think.
29:42 - Laura Dolphin: So let me just think for a second.
29:47 - Adrian Boerstra: Unless there's like a specific project you're actually going to close
out, you know, start and close for each one.
29:53 - Laura Dolphin: Well, so the reason that those were originally split is because it's so
what that is like what that actually is doing is it's looking at the process for those people,
figuring out how to track them.
30:09 - Laura Dolphin: And then make like implementing fields and flows and like, you know,
so that we can actually track that data.
30:16 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah.
30:17 - Laura Dolphin: And then report on it, but it's going to be completely different for credit.
30:21 - Adrian Boerstra: Okay, keep it separate then.
30:23 - Adrian Boerstra: Maybe just give it, just vary the name a little bit so that the name
actually shows.
30:29 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah, like credit ownership.
30:31 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah, okay, that's fine.
30:33 - Laura Dolphin: Okay, so let me ask you this.
30:36 - Laura Dolphin: I know you're meeting with Caleb.
30:38 - Laura Dolphin: Is it quicker if I just take my 15 minutes now and input the data on
your screen so that we, it's just like done for the call on Thursday or do you think that you'll
be I think that actually makes sense.
30:54 - Adrian Boerstra: You just go ahead and do that.
30:56 - Adrian Boerstra: I'm going to go make myself a coffee.
30:58 - Laura Dolphin: I was going to say, if you just make yourself a coffee, then I'll just do
it.
31:02 - Laura Dolphin: Okay, yeah, that would be great.
31:04 - Adrian Boerstra: Okay, yeah, go for it.
31:06 - Adrian Boerstra: And again, we'll make sure that so it doesn't get affected by other
changes or things I make, we'll do an export of the Json as soon as you're done so that we
have a full backup.
31:14 - Laura Dolphin: Okay, awesome.
31:17 - Laura Dolphin: I'll have a coffee too, thanks.
31:20 - Adrian Boerstra: Coming right up.
31:43 - Adrian Boerstra: you're happy.
31:45 - Laura Dolphin: Yes, I am.
31:46 - Laura Dolphin: Thank you.
31:48 - Laura Dolphin: I mean, I'd say happy wife, happy life, but not applicable, but you know
what I mean?
31:55 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah, happy female.
31:59 - Adrian Boerstra: That was Christine.
32:02 - Adrian Boerstra: Remember Christine from sugar?
32:04 - Adrian Boerstra: She's at Salesforce.
32:05 - Laura Dolphin: I do.
32:07 - Laura Dolphin: She was funny.
32:07 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah, she was very neurotic.
32:10 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
32:11 - Adrian Boerstra: But yeah, she always used to call me her work wife.
32:15 - Laura Dolphin: You were her work wife?
32:17 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah, that was probably more like it.
32:20 - Adrian Boerstra: Sorry, nothing against being a wife, you know.
32:24 - Adrian Boerstra: Wait a minute, you made that joke, not me.
32:26 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
32:27 - Adrian Boerstra: So it's fine.
32:29 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah, exactly.
37:48 - Adrian Boerstra: I am going to shift it over to...
38:11 - Laura Dolphin: What the...
38:13 - Adrian Boerstra: What happened?
38:15 - Laura Dolphin: So I just did in my Jira something.
38:17 - Laura Dolphin: Do you know how to fix this?
38:20 - Adrian Boerstra: I don't see your screen.
38:22 - Laura Dolphin: Oh, go.
38:23 - Laura Dolphin: I'm looking at your screen.
38:25 - Adrian Boerstra: I'll stop sharing.
38:26 - Adrian Boerstra: Show me what you got.
38:30 - Laura Dolphin: It's like when you're looking at an Epic and the child work items are
not there.
38:38 - Laura Dolphin: Do you know where they go?
38:40 - Adrian Boerstra: Where do the children go?
38:42 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
38:43 - Laura Dolphin: Sort, like, they're not done.
38:48 - Adrian Boerstra: No, I don't.
38:51 - Adrian Boerstra: Hang on, is this?
38:55 - Laura Dolphin: It's just a view of an epic.
38:57 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah, it's in, oh, it's like a scrolling thing.
39:02 - Adrian Boerstra: Can you go over the linked work items?
39:06 - Adrian Boerstra: Are you using, you're using a Mac, right?
39:09 - Adrian Boerstra: So.
39:09 - Laura Dolphin: No, Pc.
39:10 - Adrian Boerstra: Oh, Pc.
39:12 - Laura Dolphin: Do you have a scroll?
39:13 - Adrian Boerstra: Do you have a mouse scroll bar?
39:16 - Laura Dolphin: No.
39:17 - Laura Dolphin: Oh, like, yeah, a mouse, yeah.
39:19 - Adrian Boerstra: Ok, use that one and go over where it says, is a parent of.
39:24 - Adrian Boerstra: They're still there, but they're being cut off by a separate scrolling
thing, I think.
39:30 - Laura Dolphin: No.
39:31 - Adrian Boerstra: No?
39:32 - Laura Dolphin: No.
39:34 - Adrian Boerstra: I'm not seeing anything.
39:35 - Adrian Boerstra: Oh, that's my mouse.
39:40 - Laura Dolphin: I don't know why it's doing this.
39:43 - Adrian Boerstra: Try changing your zoom level.
39:47 - Laura Dolphin: Just no.
39:52 - Laura Dolphin: Okay, let's do a filter.
39:56 - Adrian Boerstra: I'm just seeing Maxcom 139.
39:58 - Adrian Boerstra: Is that what?
39:59 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
40:01 - Laura Dolphin: All right.
40:02 - Adrian Boerstra: I see like the one child.
40:06 - Adrian Boerstra: I'm assuming there should be more children.
40:08 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
40:10 - Laura Dolphin: Maxcom.
40:13 - Adrian Boerstra: But if you scroll down, it's still cut off, right?
40:16 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah, I've seen that before, but I don't know how to fix it.
40:19 - Adrian Boerstra: Let me just go in on my computer and see what I see.
40:23 - Laura Dolphin: Okay.
40:24 - Adrian Boerstra: Let me go to Maxcom.
40:25 - Adrian Boerstra: I have
40:29 - Adrian Boerstra: had weird things like that.
40:31 - Adrian Boerstra: And Ok, like I'm seeing all of them.
40:36 - Laura Dolphin: Ok.
40:39 - Laura Dolphin: All I need is can you just tell me on the estimate, is it actually 110
hours?
40:44 - Laura Dolphin: That's for all the subtasks?
40:46 - Laura Dolphin: I just want to know what the estimate is on that bad boy.
40:49 - Adrian Boerstra: Here, let's just come back over to my screen then.
40:52 - Laura Dolphin: Ok.
40:53 - Laura Dolphin: Because I was just trying to put in the hours for the data model, but
I couldn't see.
40:57 - Laura Dolphin: And I was like, oh, yeah.
40:59 - Laura Dolphin: Okay, what is wrong with mine?
41:01 - Laura Dolphin: Okay, so if you just...
41:03 - Adrian Boerstra: I'm going to give you the remote control again.
41:05 - Laura Dolphin: Okay, thanks.
41:07 - Adrian Boerstra: There you go.
41:08 - Laura Dolphin: Thank you.
41:12 - Laura Dolphin: Okay, so that's good.
41:14 - Adrian Boerstra: Because telling someone else what, where to go.
41:18 - Laura Dolphin: I know, it's the worst.
41:20 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah, thank you.
41:21 - Laura Dolphin: I appreciate it.
41:21 - Adrian Boerstra: If you think you respect someone's intelligence, try telling them what
to do on their screen.
41:26 - Laura Dolphin: I know, right?
41:27 - Laura Dolphin: I literally just like throw my hands up.
41:29 - Laura Dolphin: I can't do this.
41:31 - Laura Dolphin: I can't do this.
41:34 - Laura Dolphin: Okay so 137.
41:36 - Laura Dolphin: Okay I just need to fix a couple and then.
41:38 - Adrian Boerstra: I ended up putting Anydesk on my mom's computer.
41:43 - Laura Dolphin: What is that?
41:44 - Adrian Boerstra: Anydesk allows me to just basically open up her computer from my
computer and it's like what
41:50 - Adrian Boerstra: you remember what Ken and the boys were using on their, when
they were working from home and stuff
41:56 - Adrian Boerstra: they'd use their laptop and just go in on the computer that they had
in the office.
42:01 - Laura Dolphin: Yep.
42:01 - Adrian Boerstra: That so you can just basically have full remote control over a remote
computer.
42:05 - Laura Dolphin: Gotcha.
42:06 - Adrian Boerstra: Without someone else having to do anything.
42:09 - Laura Dolphin: Right, okay.
42:10 - Laura Dolphin: I remember that.
42:11 - Laura Dolphin: It always, Ken used to always get blocked on something because he
could never do it from there.
42:16 - Laura Dolphin: I can't remember who it was, but.
42:17 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah, well, it'd be if like his computer crashed or something in the
office usually.
42:21 - Laura Dolphin: Okay, I've got what I need here.
42:24 - Laura Dolphin: Okay, so I'm almost done.
42:26 - Adrian Boerstra: Cool.
42:26 - Laura Dolphin: So 108 on this guy.
42:31 - Adrian Boerstra: The other thing that I can give you is a Json export.
42:35 - Laura Dolphin: Okay.
42:36 - Adrian Boerstra: So you can see the Json format and then if you, while I'm trying to
get this accessible, if you want to make any changes to anything, you can just update it in
the Json directly.
42:47 - Adrian Boerstra: Okay.
42:48 - Adrian Boerstra: So that when I re-import it, it picks up whatever your changes are.
42:53 - Laura Dolphin: Okay.
42:54 - Laura Dolphin: Oh, that'd be cool.
42:55 - Laura Dolphin: Okay.
42:56 - Laura Dolphin: So this is high.
43:02 - Laura Dolphin: We started this here, and we're going to get it.
43:07 - Adrian Boerstra: But it is nice how it can differentiate between like, when did you start
and end, and how long on the project.
43:13 - Adrian Boerstra: Like, it's not like if you put in 40 hours, it automatically makes it a
one week project.
43:18 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah, I like that.
43:20 - Adrian Boerstra: Because we stretch things out, right?
43:22 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah, I love that.
43:23 - Laura Dolphin: That's actually my favorite part about it.
43:25 - Laura Dolphin: Whereas like, if you have other like boards, they get really rigid, but
like, no, you're not supposed to do that.
43:29 - Laura Dolphin: I like the flexibility here.
43:30 - Laura Dolphin: It's like how we work.
43:33 - Laura Dolphin: Okay, so this is good.
43:36 - Laura Dolphin: Data model.
43:38 - Laura Dolphin: What was the other thing?
43:39 - Laura Dolphin: Oh, yeah.
43:41 - Laura Dolphin: This guy.
43:45 - Laura Dolphin: Okay, so let me just get familiar with this.
43:53 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah.
43:55 - Laura Dolphin: Okay, basically what Michael wants to know is when this one.
44:00 - Laura Dolphin: This one, and the data model, this one will be done and how many
hours we need.
44:07 - Laura Dolphin: Okay.
44:08 - Laura Dolphin: I put in hours for each.
44:09 - Adrian Boerstra: You have put hours into them?
44:11 - Adrian Boerstra: So how that thing should be working, and we're just testing this right
now
44:16 - Adrian Boerstra: so how it should be working is every project that's in view
44:22 - Adrian Boerstra: it should be just adding all of them up and how many hours they
have and then dividing it by the
44:27 - Adrian Boerstra: number of months showing to average out how many hours per
month are needed to run at this pace.
44:35 - Adrian Boerstra: So, if you want...
44:37 - Laura Dolphin: Oh, okay.
44:38 - Laura Dolphin: So, these ones are not estimated.
44:40 - Adrian Boerstra: If you click on value stream, value streams on the left-hand side,
that actually works as a filter as well.
44:46 - Adrian Boerstra: So, if you want to just look at application intake, just click on that
one.
44:50 - Adrian Boerstra: See how it brings you right to the specific value stream.
44:53 - Laura Dolphin: Okay, cool.
44:54 - Laura Dolphin: But this doesn't seem to be refreshing.
44:57 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah.
44:58 - Adrian Boerstra: So, that...
44:59 - Adrian Boerstra: Maybe those filters are not...
45:02 - Adrian Boerstra: Again, that might be a bug there.
45:04 - Adrian Boerstra: Try changing the portfolio timeline to quarterly and see if it changes.
45:12 - Adrian Boerstra: Ok.
45:13 - Adrian Boerstra: How it's supposed to work is it's supposed to go toggle to the view,
but it looks like it's just doing an average of all projects, whether they're in view or not.
45:23 - Laura Dolphin: So let's, Ok.
45:24 - Laura Dolphin: So a lot of these are, Ok, here we go.
45:26 - Laura Dolphin: So help me fill this in.
45:28 - Laura Dolphin: So the automated application, oh, oops, That's the wrong one.
45:32 - Laura Dolphin: That's approval process.
45:35 - Laura Dolphin: I might just have to like randomly guess at some of these to be honest.
45:38 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah, for sure.
45:39 - Laura Dolphin: So credit ownership, time tracking.
45:43 - Adrian Boerstra: Even a guess by, even an educated guess is better than nothing,
right?
45:48 - Adrian Boerstra: So.
45:49 - Laura Dolphin: Let's say 30.
45:51 - Adrian Boerstra: Credit ownership, sure.
45:53 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah, sure.
45:56 - Laura Dolphin: Automated approval process, 30?
46:01 - Laura Dolphin: Everything is just going to get 30.
46:07 - Laura Dolphin: Sales tax.
46:12 - Laura Dolphin: See.
46:17 - Laura Dolphin: Okay.
46:28 - Laura Dolphin: An open all would be really cool.
46:34 - Adrian Boerstra: Oh, yeah, like, just make everything open.
46:37 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah.
46:37 - Laura Dolphin: Okay.

46:51 - Laura Dolphin: So maybe I'll just put it from, like, July 1st.
46:56 - Laura Dolphin: To the end of September kind of thing because it will really span over
like that quarter.
47:01 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.

48:11 - Laura Dolphin: I like this.
48:15 - Adrian Boerstra: I'm so glad.
48:16 - Adrian Boerstra: It was, you know, it's closer to the vision that I had the whole time.
48:19 - Adrian Boerstra: Sometimes I have things half-baked and the whole idea is not.
48:25 - Laura Dolphin: Have you shown this to anyone else?
48:29 - Adrian Boerstra: No.
48:31 - Adrian Boerstra: Well, actually, just before we got on this call, I showed it to Sean and
Hassan.
48:35 - Laura Dolphin: What did they say?
48:36 - Adrian Boerstra: Just like I gave them the two-minute tour.
48:39 - Adrian Boerstra: It was enough for Sean to go.
48:42 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
48:43 - Adrian Boerstra: You have to use it a bit to get into the workflow.
48:45 - Adrian Boerstra: All right, yeah, so there, take a look at that Json, see if that looks
like it makes sense to you.
48:51 - Laura Dolphin: Okay.
48:52 - Laura Dolphin: It hasn't come through the Slack yet, so maybe...
48:56 - Adrian Boerstra: Oh, I've sent it to the wrong conversation.
49:01 - Adrian Boerstra: That's probably why.
49:09 - Adrian Boerstra: There you go.
49:11 - Laura Dolphin: Perfect.
49:12 - Laura Dolphin: Awesome.
49:13 - Laura Dolphin: Okay, well, thank you.

49:20 - Adrian Boerstra: You feel good about like you can fill in the blanks here now so that
we can do on Thursday?
