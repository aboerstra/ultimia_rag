Faye + Maxim - Discuss Engagement Transcript
00:35 - Kaleb Dague: Hey, Laura, Adrian.
00:37 - Laura Dolphin: Hey, guys.
00:38 - Laura Dolphin: Hey, Michael's joining us.
00:39 - Laura Dolphin: Give him a minute.
00:40 - Laura Dolphin: Awesome.
00:41 - Adrian Boerstra: I'm not late, Kaleb.
00:45 - Laura Dolphin: Very prompt, Adrian.
00:46 - Kaleb Dague: Nice.
00:48 - Kaleb Dague: You've been avoiding me, Adrian.
00:49 - Kaleb Dague: I didn't even know you were back from vacation.
00:52 - Adrian Boerstra: I thought you were avoiding me.
00:53 - Adrian Boerstra: I was like, oh, I haven't heard from Kaleb.
00:56 - Adrian Boerstra: Usually we talk every day.
00:58 - Kaleb Dague: How was your trip?
01:01 - Adrian Boerstra: It was awesome.
01:02 - Adrian Boerstra: It was so good.
01:03 - Kaleb Dague: Nice.
01:05 - Kaleb Dague: You got back before the fourth, like what, three weeks ago?
01:08 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah, yeah, it's been, yeah, it's gonna, it's coming, I can't believe it,
yeah, it's coming up on three weeks.
01:15 - Dave Kaplan: Hey, is anyone confirmed that Michael's joining?
01:18 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah, I was just chatting with him, he'll just be a second.
01:21 - Dave Kaplan: Okay.
01:22 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
01:46 - Kaleb Dague: What was your favorite part of your trip?
01:52 - Adrian Boerstra: It was just nice to disconnect in general.
01:57 - Adrian Boerstra: So it wasn't really on a schedule.
02:01 - Adrian Boerstra: We were like booking, we booked our hotel for the first couple nights
and like the last couple and then everything else was a little bit like, oh, you know, just sort
of doing what we wanted to do.
02:11 - Kaleb Dague: Nice.
02:14 - Adrian Boerstra: So, but yeah, we went from Munich to Prague, like on the second
day, second or third day and then like I've never been to Prague or Czech Republic before.
02:27 - Adrian Boerstra: So that was pretty cool.
02:31 - Adrian Boerstra: Really, really pretty city.
02:33 - Adrian Boerstra: And so that was pretty neat.
02:35 - Adrian Boerstra: And then we went to, we visited, kind of alternated between some
larger cities, but did a lot of smaller towns that were pretty awesome.
02:49 - Adrian Boerstra: Like just a lot of really just postcard towns.
02:54 - Adrian Boerstra: My wife's birthday was on June 24th, and her favorite movie is
Sound of Music from when she was a kid, and we went and did the Sound of Music tours in
Salzburg, Austria.
03:03 - Adrian Boerstra: So that was pretty surreal for her.
03:07 - Kaleb Dague: Nice.
03:08 - Adrian Boerstra: Hey, Michael.
03:10 - Michael Kianmahd: Thank you for the flexibility.
03:12 - Michael Kianmahd: Sorry for being a minute or two late.
03:15 - Kaleb Dague: Yeah, no problem.
03:16 - Michael Kianmahd: How's everybody doing?
03:19 - Michael Kianmahd: Not bad.
03:20 - Kaleb Dague: How's everything going?
03:21 - Adrian Boerstra: Good?
03:21 - Michael Kianmahd: Good, good.
03:22 - Michael Kianmahd: I heard tidbits of your trip.
03:24 - Michael Kianmahd: Hope it was great.
03:25 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah, yeah, it was pretty awesome.
03:28 - Kaleb Dague: That was yours, Michael.
03:29 - Kaleb Dague: You were on vacation a couple weeks ago?
03:31 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah, we did Big Sur, Carmel Valley, and Carmel-by-the-sea, which
if you haven't been, strongly recommend.
03:38 - Michael Kianmahd: Nice.
03:39 - Michael Kianmahd: I should have said hi to Corey.
03:41 - Michael Kianmahd: I wasn't smart enough that week because he was in that area.
03:45 - Adrian Boerstra: Oh yeah, he's right up by there, right?
03:46 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah, he's just north, I think, of there, like maybe an hour away.
03:51 - Michael Kianmahd: But it's a beautiful part of California.
03:54 - Michael Kianmahd: It made me a prouder Californian than before.
03:59 - Adrian Boerstra: I feel like in that area, if you just introduce yourself as Corey
Gambello, you get Vip service everywhere.
04:06 - Michael Kianmahd: I dropped your name, it worked.
04:08 - Michael Kianmahd: So, our favorite connection.
04:11 - Adrian Boerstra: The only way they know me in that area is I'm the guy who went to
the hospital with a kidney stone.
04:15 - Michael Kianmahd: Oh God.
04:19 - Adrian Boerstra: There's a whole other story there.
04:21 - Michael Kianmahd: Oh god.
04:22 - Michael Kianmahd: Exactly.
04:23 - Adrian Boerstra: I said that a lot that day.
04:25 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah.
04:28 - Michael Kianmahd: Cool.
04:29 - Michael Kianmahd: So I was thinking about this.
04:36 - Michael Kianmahd: I don't know if like maybe we could start looking at that imagery
again that you had put together.
04:44 - Michael Kianmahd: I think the Github thing.
04:46 - Adrian Boerstra: Oh yeah.
04:47 - Adrian Boerstra: The portfolio.
04:48 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah.
04:49 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah, Dave, have you had a lot of time to digest it?
04:53 - Dave Kaplan: Yeah, I mean, to the degree that we've been on the calls and going into
and coming out of them.
05:00 - Michael Kianmahd: Okay, so maybe we just like level set for a minute or two and just
get on the same page.
05:06 - Michael Kianmahd: Around that.
05:08 - Laura Dolphin: Give me a sec here.
05:11 - Laura Dolphin: I can pull it up.
05:12 - Michael Kianmahd: Okay, I'll just kind of like share with you all the updates I have
from our side.
05:19 - Michael Kianmahd: And just have to thread the needle over here.
05:27 - Michael Kianmahd: Okay, so based on collective advice, we came up with value
streams and mini projects.
05:38 - Michael Kianmahd: Laura did her t-shirt time sizing exercise, which we haven't looked
at for a few weeks.
05:49 - Michael Kianmahd: So I realize that this is probably directly correct.
05:54 - Michael Kianmahd: It's probably not accurate or precise.
05:59 - Michael Kianmahd: Do you guys agree with me there?
06:01 - Michael Kianmahd: We're not.
06:02 - Adrian Boerstra: Yep.
06:03 - Michael Kianmahd: Okay, good.
06:04 - Michael Kianmahd: So that was kind of the key takeaway that I had.
06:09 - Dave Kaplan: You said directionally correct, not directionally incorrect, correct?
06:13 - Michael Kianmahd: I said directionally correct.
06:16 - Michael Kianmahd: And...
06:17 - Michael Kianmahd: Right.
06:17 - Adrian Boerstra: This is more for high-level planning as opposed to real-life.
06:21 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah.
06:22 - Adrian Boerstra: Like...
06:23 - Michael Kianmahd: I don't know.
06:25 - Michael Kianmahd: Listen, we're going north, but someone might see Corey, some-
one might see me in Big Sur.
06:29 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah, exactly.
06:31 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah.
06:31 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah, someone might have a kidney stone.
06:33 - Michael Kianmahd: You know, an overshoot or undershoot, basically.
06:36 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah.
06:36 - Michael Kianmahd: Or end up in the valley somewhere, but it's all good.
06:39 - Michael Kianmahd: We're still in California.
06:43 - Michael Kianmahd: Okay, so I think one of the things that has been really tough
internally
06:55 - Michael Kianmahd: personally, and externally with like people we actually do busi-
ness with that would actually benefit from the value as well and kind of help us do more
deals and more business and do it more efficiently and all those kind of things.
07:10 - Michael Kianmahd: Is that it's been hard to it's been hard to manage like timelines,
cost expectations.
07:20 - Michael Kianmahd: It's kind of hard to know what the end state might look like or
feel like or be like.
07:25 - Michael Kianmahd: And there's like a level of uncertainty around this.
07:27 - Michael Kianmahd: So I feel like my like the only logical reaction to that is like not
to use something is coming until it's there and then get your arms around what you get and
then market.
07:38 - Michael Kianmahd: It's like this discount to what you can actually do so that people
don't feel like it's actually not that great or it's not a huge improvement or that kind of thing.
07:49 - Michael Kianmahd: And I say that because that's kind of been our experience with
the I.o.
07:52 - Michael Kianmahd: So far, like, that's kind of like, you know, we kind of tested it.
07:55 - Michael Kianmahd: People got it.
07:56 - Michael Kianmahd: there's feedback.
07:58 - Michael Kianmahd: I think it was smart not to like kind of release it across
08:00 - Michael Kianmahd: the board and I think for the internal type customers you know
if you want to
08:05 - Michael Kianmahd: call them that and the kind of external world I think there's like
there's gonna
08:09 - Michael Kianmahd: be a lot of learning going on and there's still the deal of all in we're
08:12 - Michael Kianmahd: processing so I just don't have my mind fully wrapped around
that I don't see
08:17 - Michael Kianmahd: that vision yet.
08:19 - Adrian Boerstra: I think if I understand what you're saying is like when we're taking
on, you know, certain, certainly projects of a certain size, we should basically always plan
for like, let's do an Mvp phase, you know, minimum viable product, roll that out to a limited
degree, gather feedback.
08:38 - Adrian Boerstra: And like, just generally have a formal repeatable workflow for
making sure we do some sort of pilot.
08:47 - Adrian Boerstra: And then decision making, is that what you're saying?
08:49 - Michael Kianmahd: No, I think it depends what it is actually.
08:51 - Michael Kianmahd: So I think there are some things like probably new features, yes
Adrian, absolutely that's the smartest way to do it, but like the data model I don't think you
could do that.
08:58 - Michael Kianmahd: I think it's like it's a pretty relevant.
09:01 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah absolutely, yeah makes sense.
09:03 - Michael Kianmahd: So I think we probably have to be mentally nimble enough to be
thoughtful about which path we take.
09:12 - Michael Kianmahd: So but I'm open to both and I see the value in both and I'll take
your guidance and suggestions and wisdom and mentorship.
09:19 - Michael Kianmahd: And you guys can be our protective kind of, what do you call it?
09:27 - Michael Kianmahd: Like body armor around getting bruises if we make, keep us from
getting bruises basically.
09:32 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah.
09:33 - Michael Kianmahd: Okay, so if we scroll down, there's basically meaningful value
streams.
09:40 - Michael Kianmahd: So there's the intake, there's the credit, or if you scroll down.
09:44 - Laura Dolphin: Hang on, sorry.
09:45 - Laura Dolphin: Is that, can I make it smaller or can you guys see that?
09:48 - Michael Kianmahd: I could see it still.
09:49 - Adrian Boerstra: I can still see it, yep.
09:51 - Michael Kianmahd: I'm just gonna be really close to the camera if you guys don't
mind.
09:54 - Laura Dolphin: I'll just scroll really slowly, just tell me to stop.
09:59 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah, so intake credit docs funding
10:05 - Michael Kianmahd: servicing and collections
10:10 - Michael Kianmahd: client broker dealer relationship management
10:17 - Michael Kianmahd: And then product and program design.
10:21 - Michael Kianmahd: Maintenance.
10:23 - Michael Kianmahd: Which I guess is what axia is really supposed to be used for.
10:28 - Michael Kianmahd: And then what else is there?
10:30 - Michael Kianmahd: That's it, right?
10:31 - Laura Dolphin: That's your axia at the bottom here.
10:33 - Michael Kianmahd: Ok, awesome.
10:35 - Michael Kianmahd: Cool, so one of the things that Laura and I.
10:39 - Michael Kianmahd: Did after this group met was we kind of I don't think we fully did
it.
10:46 - Michael Kianmahd: I think there's probably more to do there.
10:48 - Michael Kianmahd: Maybe, I don't know.
10:50 - Michael Kianmahd: It's hard for me to know.
10:52 - Michael Kianmahd: But like each one of these lines that have a color that fit within a
rock, or fit within a value stream, maybe it could be tailored, maybe it could be shaved down,
maybe it's a little bit too conservative of an estimate.
11:08 - Michael Kianmahd: And the way I think about this is if you have like, if it's directionally
correct, but there's just across the board, like a 50% margin of error.
11:15 - Michael Kianmahd: It makes it seem like this is 50% more expensive than it will take
because
11:19 - Michael Kianmahd: you're not, you're not getting any benefit of anything taking less
time
11:23 - Michael Kianmahd: than what was budgeted, like nothing's going to come in 50%
under and
11:26 - Michael Kianmahd: everything's going to be 50% over the number that you may have
mentally put
11:30 - Michael Kianmahd: in was not a t-shirt 50% too large for you.
11:34 - Michael Kianmahd: I don't know.
11:34 - Michael Kianmahd: I don't know what that number is.
11:35 - Michael Kianmahd: I don't have a feel for it because I don't do this, but that's like one
major high-level concern as we talk about scope and budget and all this kind of things.
11:45 - Michael Kianmahd: So I don't know if that you guys, I think, just make a note of that.
11:49 - Michael Kianmahd: Because I don't know if we could kind of shorten this or sort of
cut it down or make it simpler
11:55 - Michael Kianmahd: or whatever it is, but that's kind of one major thing that also leads
to later delivery
12:00 - Michael Kianmahd: not just cost, higher complexity, higher rate of failure, that kind
of thing.
12:04 - Michael Kianmahd: So those are major things.
12:05 - Adrian Boerstra: We're talking about generally planning to compress projects.
12:08 - Adrian Boerstra: So maybe we do fewer projects simultaneously and just sort of do
a hard focus on one, get it done and then go to the next.
12:18 - Adrian Boerstra: Is that kind of what you're talking about there?
12:21 - Michael Kianmahd: I think it may lead to that.
12:22 - Michael Kianmahd: I think I'm more, I'm just like cost benefit impact, right?
12:27 - Michael Kianmahd: Like complexity, like all those things and risk, like all those things
I was talking about.
12:34 - Michael Kianmahd: So I think like this was put together with that in mind.
12:39 - Michael Kianmahd: It's just not that clear.
12:42 - Michael Kianmahd: And if something could be, like, for example, like there's some
stuff here that's like stretched over.
12:48 - Michael Kianmahd: I forgot what it was, Laura, but if you go up a little bit, it'll probably
jog my memory.
12:53 - Michael Kianmahd: Like Aio enhancements, merging Trmbl.
13:02 - Michael Kianmahd: There's some stuff that I wonder, Maybe you got to zoom out a
little bit more because it's like, yeah, there's like some stuff that bleeds on for a long time.
13:12 - Michael Kianmahd: And I think part of what's also hard to tell is like what exactly is
causing that stretch.
13:18 - Michael Kianmahd: Is it the availability of people?
13:22 - Michael Kianmahd: Is it because that's just how long it takes?
13:25 - Michael Kianmahd: Is it something else I'm not aware about or aware of?
13:30 - Michael Kianmahd: Is it, you know, so the way I think about this in terms of like
managing internal expectations and external is we're not gonna be in like quote unquote
production until the end of the year, which is, you know, is that right?
13:48 - Michael Kianmahd: Would you agree with me?
13:50 - Michael Kianmahd: No, it's not right?
13:51 - Laura Dolphin: No.
13:52 - Michael Kianmahd: Okay.
13:53 - Laura Dolphin: Well, I think it's just like, I mean, we haven't really had this conversation
actually before I go, can you guys hear that background noise?
13:59 - Michael Kianmahd: No.
13:59 - Laura Dolphin: Okay, good, because it's driving me insane.
14:02 - Laura Dolphin: Sorry, so...
14:03 - Michael Kianmahd: I'll just be talking.
14:06 - Adrian Boerstra: Is that on your side, Laura?
14:09 - Laura Dolphin: Oh, wait, it stopped.
14:10 - Laura Dolphin: Hang on.
14:14 - Laura Dolphin: Okay, so we haven't talked about this for a while, but if you remember,
this one stretches on because it's literally just meant to represent a monthly hourly.
14:23 - Michael Kianmahd: That I know, yeah.
14:24 - Laura Dolphin: And then you and I went through this, just you and me, we stretch
these out so that we could basically try and get it down and to fit into a budget.
14:32 - Laura Dolphin: Right.
14:32 - Laura Dolphin: And so what that meant is like, you know, move this out and then
you've got more hours to push the data model in.
14:38 - Laura Dolphin: But with that being said, there's also just literal physical, like time
constraints that we cannot physically deliver something within a month.
14:46 - Laura Dolphin: Just due to the fact that there are multiple parties involved on both
sides.
14:49 - Laura Dolphin: There are, they're like partners, right?
14:51 - Laura Dolphin: Like I don't control calendars and other people as much as I would
like to.
14:55 - Laura Dolphin: So there's literally like physical things that just mean it's not just me
doing something.
15:01 - Laura Dolphin: I rely on other people I rely on them their schedules things like that.
15:04 - Laura Dolphin: So like you physically sometimes cannot move faster and I'm not one
to say yet.
15:10 - Laura Dolphin: We can do that if I know it can't be done So that's why this is like that's
why this is the way that it is Is it stretched out to present a realistic situation of you want
these things?
15:22 - Laura Dolphin: this is what is like incorporated it, and this is a realistic timeframe.
15:26 - Laura Dolphin: That's just what that represents.
15:28 - Michael Kianmahd: If that makes sense.
15:29 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah, that makes total sense, and I think we're on the same page.
15:34 - Michael Kianmahd: So I'm less concerned, I'm more focused on getting it done as
quickly as possible, like and making sure it's done right, and cost is secondary to me.
15:48 - Michael Kianmahd: And cost is almost like a separate conversation.
15:51 - Michael Kianmahd: I could have that with Dave and Caleb directly, if you guys prefer.
15:57 - Michael Kianmahd: And we can leave that out.
15:58 - Michael Kianmahd: But I guess just like one question is like, is there like a very high,
high level of certainty that we could deliver on this plan?
16:07 - Laura Dolphin: When you say this plan, are you just talking about your data model,
merging tier and the scoring?
16:11 - Laura Dolphin: Cause I'm guessing you're not talking about all of this.
16:14 - Adrian Boerstra: Are you talking about resources and like?
16:17 - Michael Kianmahd: I'm talking about executing on these timelines, these hours, and
deadlines, and all the items like one through eight.
16:28 - Adrian Boerstra: What our experience is in answer to that question is there's probably
at least one project in here that's going to take twice as long as what we actually think it will.
16:42 - Adrian Boerstra: But there's going to be other ones that are going to take less time.
16:45 - Adrian Boerstra: So across the portfolio like this
16:48 - Adrian Boerstra: the answer would be yes at like a high level
16:51 - Adrian Boerstra: but like the small, in fact
16:53 - Adrian Boerstra: it's the smaller the projects get
16:55 - Adrian Boerstra: the more likely they are to double
16:56 - Adrian Boerstra: because if you think something's gonna be 10 hours
16:58 - Adrian Boerstra: or 16 hours to get it done
17:01 - Adrian Boerstra: those are the ones that are the worst
17:02 - Adrian Boerstra: because sometimes like one curve ball adds another day
17:06 - Adrian Boerstra: and suddenly you've doubled the project.
17:09 - Adrian Boerstra: But I would say across our whole portfolio, I'd be surprised if we
were out by any more than 10 to 15%.
17:19 - Dave Kaplan: Do you, to extend his question, do you and Laura feel that these
estimates, barring any change in business requirements, are on the low end of resourcing?
17:35 - Laura Dolphin: So, some of them are lower, some of them are higher, and some of
them are pretty accurate.
17:42 - Laura Dolphin: I've called most of those out.
17:44 - Laura Dolphin: Some of them I literally have no idea.
17:46 - Laura Dolphin: So I just teach I literally just T-shirt sized it.
17:48 - Laura Dolphin: That could go either way in all honesty, because I just haven't scoped
it out.
17:52 - Laura Dolphin: What Michael and I actually ended up doing is we took out some of
the initiatives and replaced it with a smaller 1, which is literally like 8 hours of discovery.
18:01 - Laura Dolphin: And then I could actually put on an accurate estimate for some of
those projects.
18:07 - Laura Dolphin: There are some on here that potentially are under.
18:14 - Laura Dolphin: Definitely, to just answer the question simply.
18:18 - Laura Dolphin: By how much though, I don't know.
18:21 - Adrian Boerstra: I think, didn't we put a dropdown in here, Laura, to indicate our
confidence in the estimate itself, or did we just talk about that?
18:27 - Adrian Boerstra: I can't remember.
18:29 - Laura Dolphin: I can't remember if we did.
18:31 - Laura Dolphin: It's honestly, I haven't come in, I've updated ours.
18:35 - Adrian Boerstra: We're going to do it in status.
18:37 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
18:38 - Laura Dolphin: It's on one of the roadmap things.
18:41 - Laura Dolphin: But yeah.
18:44 - Laura Dolphin: To answer the question, yes, there's probably someone here that are
under.
18:49 - Michael Kianmahd: Ok.
18:50 - Michael Kianmahd: So I view that as a failure point.
18:52 - Michael Kianmahd: I view that as expectation, reality, mismatch, which I think needs
to get covered.
19:02 - Adrian Boerstra: Sorry, can we lean into that a little bit?
19:06 - Dave Kaplan: The only way to avoid that is to do one of two things.
19:11 - Dave Kaplan: Either we just estimate artificially high, but that's not going to help your
business decision, and not going to get monies back.
19:21 - Dave Kaplan: That's probably not a preferred approach.
19:24 - Dave Kaplan: Or we take X number of hours in the first month of the agreement with
some language and run the mini discoveries on the lower confidence items and come back
with a refinement over or under on those items.
19:46 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah, I mean, the whole idea of the t-shirt sizing is that we are doing
a ballpark so that we can just generally plan out the overall timeline.
19:57 - Adrian Boerstra: The intention at the point of t-shirt sizing isn't, like I don't, from a
process perspective, I don't see it as a failure at that stage.
20:06 - Adrian Boerstra: But at the point that we actually get started doing Sow and scope
something out a little bit more, then we're looking to definitely take that a lot more accurate
than t-shirt size.
20:17 - Adrian Boerstra: But the problem is, is a chicken or the egg situation.
20:21 - Dave Kaplan: If we don't see- I don't think it's a failure in the estimating process.
20:24 - Dave Kaplan: I'm suggesting Michael's saying it could be a failure between an
agreement and expectations if there's a variance.
20:31 - Dave Kaplan: And that's fair.
20:32 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah, yeah.
20:33 - Adrian Boerstra: We'd want to get that part worked out before getting started on it,
sure.
20:37 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah.
20:38 - Michael Kianmahd: Let me try to sharpen questions, just because it's going to help
me clarify my thinking a bit more.
20:46 - Michael Kianmahd: So what's the total number of hours sort of layered here right
now?
20:58 - Adrian Boerstra: Well, it's averaging out to 177 hours per month over a period of
about six months.
21:05 - Adrian Boerstra: So there's about 1,200, roughly, a little under maybe 1,100 hours
represented here.
21:16 - Dave Kaplan: You said 177 times six, right?
21:20 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah.
21:22 - Dave Kaplan: 1062, it's called 1100.
21:25 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah.
21:28 - Michael Kianmahd: Okay, cool.
21:31 - Michael Kianmahd: And then there's like several streams of kind of talent or re-
sources that are being brought on.
21:41 - Michael Kianmahd: And I remember, Laura, you showed me a chart that summarize
that really beautifully.
21:47 - Michael Kianmahd: I don't remember if it was in Github, it might be.
21:53 - Laura Dolphin: Should you chart?
21:55 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah, you remember you're like, it's the me and the Adrian and
it's, you know, this, and then it's, you know, the developers and the junior person and like,
there's like different hourly rates based on the type of people.
22:06 - Michael Kianmahd: It was just like the- It was the summary of all of those.
22:10 - Adrian Boerstra: It might be on the resources under the- Hang on, yeah.
22:15 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah, let me say Dave is this too much detail for your level?
22:19 - Michael Kianmahd: Or is this helpful to you as well?
22:23 - Dave Kaplan: It's not too much detail and I mean, I want to drive this to closure, so
I'd rather hear what you're thinking and.
22:28 - Michael Kianmahd: Okay, cool.
22:30 - Dave Kaplan: I closed.
22:31 - Michael Kianmahd: Thank you for the time.
22:34 - Michael Kianmahd: Um, I.
22:37 - Kaleb Dague: We did share the commercials with you, Michael, maybe that's what
you're referring to, which I wonder if you're talking about that rate card in the summation
table and in the.
22:45 - Dave Kaplan: Yeah.
22:46 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah, like, summed up how much of Laura's time Adrian's time.
22:49 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah.
22:49 - Michael Kianmahd: There you go.
22:50 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah.
22:51 - Michael Kianmahd: Okay.
22:56 - Michael Kianmahd: Hours per quarter.
23:00 - Michael Kianmahd: So it's two quarters.
23:03 - Michael Kianmahd: Right?
23:04 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah.
23:06 - Michael Kianmahd: So is that does that total what was just said?
23:12 - Kaleb Dague: So we also have these resources and then we also have the Axio built
in, which is still giving you the 90 hours per quarter and that's the resource of Adrian and
Laura.
23:24 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah it still definitely looks shy of like 1,100 hours over the next six
months though.
23:30 - Dave Kaplan: Yeah those commercials only come up if back in the envelope like
what's that 780 hours right?
23:38 - Kaleb Dague: I believe so yeah.
23:39 - Dave Kaplan: So 210 is 300 times two, 600, and then 90 times two, 180, so 780.
23:50 - Michael Kianmahd: Wait, what's the math you're doing?
23:51 - Michael Kianmahd: I just wanna make sure I understand.
23:53 - Dave Kaplan: Well, just- You have three hours per quarter in Axia.
23:57 - Michael Kianmahd: How many?
23:58 - Dave Kaplan: 90, nine zero, right?
24:00 - Michael Kianmahd: Okay.
24:01 - Dave Kaplan: Is that correct, Caleb, Adrian?
24:03 - Kaleb Dague: Yes, yeah, correct.
24:05 - Dave Kaplan: 90 times two is 180 for Axia over a six month period.
24:10 - Dave Kaplan: And then this is a 300 hours per quarter times two.
24:16 - Dave Kaplan: So 600.
24:17 - Dave Kaplan: So Axia 180, Fte 600 cross splits.
24:20 - Adrian Boerstra: I think we're about 140 hours shy over the six months.
24:26 - Dave Kaplan: In the commercials, it doesn't mean that, you know, we can't guarantee
the same overage and what the two week notice, you know.
24:32 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
24:34 - Dave Kaplan: First round of refuse on the resources and all that, which I think Michael,
you would prefer to be under commercially than what the potential number might be, right?
24:44 - Dave Kaplan: At the risk of having some overages, but not being committed and
paying for stuff you don't use.
24:52 - Michael Kianmahd: I rather have like, I don't know, I don't know what I think yet.
25:00 - Michael Kianmahd: I'm just still trying to understand.
25:02 - Michael Kianmahd: So like that, like what I just pointed out is like a mismatch I noticed
in my review of stuff, yeah?
25:07 - Adrian Boerstra: A little bit, yeah.
25:08 - Adrian Boerstra: But I think what Dave's pointing out here is that
25:12 - Adrian Boerstra: we have ways of being able to
25:13 - Adrian Boerstra: if there's a little bit of an overage versus what
25:16 - Adrian Boerstra: so if we think it's gonna be 1,100 hours
25:18 - Adrian Boerstra: but we have a committed amount of say 960 hours
25:23 - Adrian Boerstra: which is what that's gonna add up to
25:26 - Adrian Boerstra: what that does is, or is it 86?
25:29 - Michael Kianmahd: 780.
25:30 - Dave Kaplan: 880.
25:31 - Adrian Boerstra: 960, 960, yeah.
25:33 - Adrian Boerstra: So if that adds up to 960, it means- 780, isn't it?
25:37 - Michael Kianmahd: 780.
25:39 - Adrian Boerstra: 300, oh yeah, you're right, you're right, sorry.
25:43 - Adrian Boerstra: I was adding an extra, not an Epr.
25:45 - Adrian Boerstra: So 300, yes.
25:49 - Michael Kianmahd: So- Yeah, that's off by 50%, right?
25:53 - Michael Kianmahd: 26, yeah.
25:57 - Adrian Boerstra: So if you go 780, the difference
26:02 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah, yeah, roughly.
26:04 - Dave Kaplan: The commercial commit is, we came in with the commercial commit
being generally 25% at least lower than estimates.
26:15 - Dave Kaplan: That's how we price most things with the guaranteed overage and
supporting verbiage in an Ft situation.
26:23 - Dave Kaplan: You know, you would just need two weeks notice to use, to need more
of them.
26:29 - Dave Kaplan: So like that's a non-issue in our Sop.
26:31 - Dave Kaplan: I mean, if you want that commit gap to be closer, I'm happy to do that.
26:37 - Dave Kaplan: But committing commercially to something, and we find out that eight
out of 10 of the estimates were actually conservative to your opening comments, then your
committed contractually to something you're not gonna need, and that's not a situation.
26:53 - Adrian Boerstra: So maybe what we should be including in here, Michael, is just
because this is what you're commercially committing to doesn't mean that that's what you
should budget for.
27:03 - Adrian Boerstra: But from a contract perspective, it's easier for us to say, hey, if we
go over, we'll give you this rate for those overage than if we come in under, you've already
got a commitment to an Fte.
27:17 - Adrian Boerstra: You know what I mean?
27:18 - Dave Kaplan: That's a good point.
27:19 - Dave Kaplan: And maybe we missed that, Michael, and I'll take that.
27:21 - Dave Kaplan: But like, we have a pretty large client that, you know, for a bunch of
reasons, doesn't want to ever commit over what they think they might use.
27:30 - Dave Kaplan: And they write internally, purchase record Po 40% higher than the
contract, so that she doesn't have to go back to the well, so she's covered.
27:40 - Dave Kaplan: But I'm not, that's the essence of what we're describing here.
27:43 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah, so just for clarity, this was generated off of the 130, not the 177,
so the 780 is correct
27:52 - Laura Dolphin: because I cannot physically take myself out, like I cannot hand over
everything, so just remember
28:00 - Laura Dolphin: that I am physically going to be a blocker for some of these things
because of the way that
28:06 - Laura Dolphin: they work.
28:06 - Laura Dolphin: And so what I did is I said how much am I available and then who else
do I need.
28:11 - Laura Dolphin: So that was maybe the table that you're looking at.
28:14 - Laura Dolphin: And so I took that and said, how much of Adrian and me are
committed?
28:18 - Laura Dolphin: Where the keys?
28:20 - Laura Dolphin: And then I said, how much of an engineer do I need?
28:23 - Laura Dolphin: How much of a junior consultant can I use and do I need?
28:26 - Laura Dolphin: And then that came up with the 130.
28:29 - Michael Kianmahd: And remember it's gonna fluctuate.
28:31 - Michael Kianmahd: I see.
28:33 - Laura Dolphin: So it's gonna fluctuate, but that 177 is saying if we get aggressive and
we take these t-shirt sizes, this is about how much hours we're gonna need per month, but
it doesn't mean that we need 177 hours per month.
28:46 - Laura Dolphin: I gave the 130, which is like how much you can have or how much I
can commit, how much Adrian can commit, and then who else can help on the projects that
are on the roadmap based off their priority.
29:00 - Laura Dolphin: So just keep in mind, there's a lot of factors that came in.
29:03 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah, it's not just like 177 math is wrong.
29:07 - Adrian Boerstra: So the reality is that project plan probably still needs to be shifted
around a little bit to come within the resource budget there too.
29:17 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
29:19 - Laura Dolphin: I mean, we can shift.
29:20 - Laura Dolphin: Michael and I did the shifting, so I know the priorities.
29:23 - Laura Dolphin: And a lot of that is based off of that.
29:25 - Laura Dolphin: But there's only so many things that certain people can do.
29:28 - Laura Dolphin: And because projects differ in what you need, that's what is that.
29:35 - Laura Dolphin: There's stuff that I physically cannot hand over, or there's stuff that
is physically like only an engineer versus only a junior consultant, if you know what I mean.
29:43 - Laura Dolphin: And just when you put it on a calendar, it just, it equates to like that.
29:49 - Michael Kianmahd: Well, I see it.
29:49 - Adrian Boerstra: And I also see looking at the project plan that it's still pretty heavily
weighted on the front.
29:57 - Laura Dolphin: What we're doing right now, most of it is very, yeah.
30:01 - Adrian Boerstra: It's like, yeah, it's...
30:05 - Dave Kaplan: No, these are all, we have a lot in play here.
30:07 - Dave Kaplan: Those are all interrelated, but simply stated, there is level of effort
measured in hours, and that's what it takes to do the task.
30:16 - Dave Kaplan: Like that is what we have to agree upon, knowing what we know today
for the work stream.
30:21 - Dave Kaplan: There is then taking the level of effort and putting it against a calendar
with the resources and establishing critical path in timeline.
30:30 - Dave Kaplan: And that's what Laura is talking about, that is second.
30:34 - Dave Kaplan: and then there is the extension of Loe and time to dollars, which I can
handle with Michael.
30:40 - Dave Kaplan: So the first question on the Loe, we t-shirt sized all of them, some with
higher levels of confidence than others.
30:48 - Dave Kaplan: The only way to mitigate the lower confidence ones
30:54 - Dave Kaplan: is to either up them to be conservative
30:57 - Dave Kaplan: so there's not a failure point
30:59 - Dave Kaplan: in expectations to use Michael's terms
31:02 - Dave Kaplan: or to spend some time on the front end of the new agreement
31:08 - Dave Kaplan: refining those and resetting expectations up or down
31:12 - Dave Kaplan: for those lower confidence items.
31:14 - Dave Kaplan: I don't know another way to handle it.
31:19 - Laura Dolphin: I feel pretty confident though, in like the ones that we're working on
now, those were the ones that I have a higher level of confidence on.
31:27 - Laura Dolphin: So the ones that I'm not as confident about the ones that are kind of
like next quarter plus.
31:32 - Laura Dolphin: I don't know if that helps or not.
31:35 - Michael Kianmahd: What is just I want to make sure I understand the word.
31:38 - Michael Kianmahd: So what does Loe mean?
31:40 - Dave Kaplan: Level of effort.
31:40 - Dave Kaplan: Sorry.
31:41 - Michael Kianmahd: Level of effort.
31:42 - Michael Kianmahd: Okay.
31:43 - Dave Kaplan: Total number of hours to perform a unit of work.
31:45 - Dave Kaplan: That's fundamentally the most important thing here.
31:49 - Adrian Boerstra: But I think one of the things Michael was pointing out is if he just
said, okay, I'm going to sign off on this and budgeted this, It would be inadequate to actually
cover everything we've got estimated out over the next six months to.
32:01 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah, the other thing I'd say is you're going to be like, if I said,
okay, whatever the number is, let's do it.
32:10 - Michael Kianmahd: What I'm not clear on.
32:12 - Michael Kianmahd: Is whether the timeline is achievable and what it sounds like is
if we hit 1100 hours, because of whatever reason.
32:20 - Michael Kianmahd: We're going to be 40% over budget, which is material.
32:24 - Dave Kaplan: I would just refine the statement.
32:26 - Dave Kaplan: You'd be 40% over the contract you signed.
32:29 - Dave Kaplan: But the budget quote unquote would be up to your expectations
internally.
32:34 - Dave Kaplan: So if we did actually this conversation agreeing that your budget was.
32:39 - Dave Kaplan: You know, 200,000, but you wanted to contractually commit to 150.
32:45 - Dave Kaplan: You would be squared away and you would just know that the 50 K is
not a contractual commit.
32:51 - Dave Kaplan: So you have the luxury of.
32:53 - Dave Kaplan: If we come in under, you're not paying for it.
32:55 - Dave Kaplan: If we come in over, you're covered on the rates within it.
32:58 - Dave Kaplan: We can certainly do something different, but that's where mine is right
now.
33:03 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah, I get it.
33:08 - Michael Kianmahd: I think what I realized is my confidence is a derivative of your
confidence in delivering on time and on budget, quote unquote, however we want to phrase
that, because I can't derive confidence.
33:23 - Michael Kianmahd: I'm not the one who's doing it, so I can't bet on myself per
33:27 - Michael Kianmahd: say I can only bet on my decision making and what that forces
me to do is it forces me to like
33:35 - Michael Kianmahd: kind of put my arms around the bear and understand why and
ask a bunch of questions which I think you
33:41 - Michael Kianmahd: guys have done a fantastic job I've learned a lot and I'm really
grateful for that because
33:46 - Michael Kianmahd: it's very time consuming for everyone I'm sure but it helps me
make be a better decision maker
33:52 - Michael Kianmahd: and sort of invest and you know what gets measured gets
managed what gets shared hopefully gets
33:59 - Michael Kianmahd: understood and I think like you know your team has done a good
job with that at least for me
34:03 - Michael Kianmahd: personally in my style especially like not having a dedicated
in-house resource to manage it on our
34:09 - Michael Kianmahd: behalf which we hope to have soon.
34:12 - Michael Kianmahd: So I guess flipping it back like Adrian and Laura with
34:18 - Michael Kianmahd: like how close you are to us
34:21 - Michael Kianmahd: and the level of engagement you've had with us
34:24 - Michael Kianmahd: and sort of the time spent on all the things you've been doing
34:27 - Michael Kianmahd: and the progress you've been making on the data model
34:30 - Michael Kianmahd: and some of the other things we've done in the past.
34:33 - Michael Kianmahd: How confident are you in the 1100 hours as a hard rule?
34:39 - Adrian Boerstra: Do you think- I am highly confident in that number, Michael.
34:42 - Adrian Boerstra: So when I kind of gave you the exceptions, I'm trying to not set Laura
up for like, so I've worked with Laura for a very long time and she's an under promise, over
deliver person and she's extremely reliable over the longterm.
35:01 - Adrian Boerstra: But like I said, I'm trying not to hang anyone out to dry because any
one small project or whatever can easily vary.
35:09 - Adrian Boerstra: But I feel very, very comfortable around that, 1100 hours and the
overall scope of what we're going to do.
35:17 - Adrian Boerstra: Knowing that there's probably going
35:18 - Adrian Boerstra: to be some trade-offs where one thing's going to take a little longer,
again, the smaller the
35:23 - Adrian Boerstra: project, easy for those to take double, but over the grand scheme
and looking, and I've worked with
35:30 - Adrian Boerstra: Laura around all of these estimates, Laura, while you've experienced
it firsthand, Michael, if Laura
35:37 - Adrian Boerstra: thinks it's going to take another 20 hours, she says it, and she's not
trying to sell you on
35:41 - Adrian Boerstra: anything.
35:42 - Michael Kianmahd: No, yeah, that's I'm less worried about the sale or worried about
the planning.
35:51 - Michael Kianmahd: But I appreciate that.
35:54 - Michael Kianmahd: And then Laura, you align with Adrian on that.
35:57 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah, what do you mean the planning?
36:01 - Dave Kaplan: Um, I'm on achievable.
36:03 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah, timeline hours.
36:06 - Michael Kianmahd: Like, how much time from us you need.
36:09 - Michael Kianmahd: So we can budget that also was like, you're not doing it in a
vacuum.
36:13 - Michael Kianmahd: So like, I, you know, I'd want to understand like, who do you want
available?
36:17 - Michael Kianmahd: How do you want them available?
36:18 - Michael Kianmahd: When, how frequent, and then how do we run the business while
we're not talking about digital transformation?
36:27 - Laura Dolphin: I can, I can average who I need and how long.
36:30 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah.
36:31 - Michael Kianmahd: But that was like the second order issue.
36:34 - Michael Kianmahd: Like I'm still on first order.
36:35 - Michael Kianmahd: So, yeah.
36:36 - Laura Dolphin: Um, in terms of confidence.
36:38 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
36:38 - Laura Dolphin: I, I feel pretty confident.
36:40 - Laura Dolphin: Um.
36:43 - Michael Kianmahd: Would it be worth our time to revisit assumptions on that
document?
36:49 - Michael Kianmahd: Or do you think it's not worth our time?
36:52 - Adrian Boerstra: I'm going to.
36:53 - Adrian Boerstra: So, from, from my perspective.
36:56 - Adrian Boerstra: I think from a process perspective, I just want to be clear.
36:59 - Adrian Boerstra: Almost everything on our project timeline will get re well I shouldn't
say almost everything's there are some that have already gone through very detailed scop-
ing.
37:08 - Adrian Boerstra: and the ones that are more at the t-shirt size phase, not only should
we be, but we must, we will soak those out.
37:15 - Adrian Boerstra: Part of the process is to groom every ticket.
37:18 - Adrian Boerstra: So we have like some, some of these are based on already docu-
mented user stories and some of them are based on, hey, just what we kind of think based
on our experience with a finger in the air.
37:27 - Adrian Boerstra: So we will not start any project while we still have just a finger in
the air about what it's going to take.
37:34 - Adrian Boerstra: Everything will go through the same sort of rigorous process
anything that hasn't will before we get going on the project.
37:42 - Adrian Boerstra: So I don't think we need like one split out effort to go through
everything at that.
37:50 - Adrian Boerstra: That's just going to be part of the process.
37:52 - Adrian Boerstra: So the idea right now is how confident are we overall with that 1100
hours that we're going to get done what we think we have set.
38:00 - Adrian Boerstra: I feel very, very confident about that.
38:02 - Adrian Boerstra: that, knowing that there will be variations as we start to groom,
define user stories on the ones where it hasn't been defined yet.
38:10 - Adrian Boerstra: But I feel very confident overall that, you know, with the accom-
modating for pluses and minuses, that the size of this whole project and portfolio will
compensate for the variances.
38:25 - Michael Kianmahd: No, I understand that there's like a level of you can't predict
everything all at once.
38:29 - Michael Kianmahd: You can't learn more over time.
38:31 - Michael Kianmahd: Like I totally got that from first-hand experience, believe it or not.
38:37 - Michael Kianmahd: Unrelated to software.
38:41 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah, I'm just saying that we will go through the rigor.
38:43 - Adrian Boerstra: Like there's no should we, will we.
38:46 - Adrian Boerstra: We will.
38:47 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah, I guess it hasn't been gone through with that level Yeah, I
mean, there's probably two types of errors that I want to avoid.
38:56 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah.
38:56 - Michael Kianmahd: Type one is you're like 70% done.
39:01 - Michael Kianmahd: We realize this is not the right solution or it's not the right method
or we misunderstood something.
39:06 - Michael Kianmahd: So we gave you bad advice.
39:08 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah, but it's your fault, client.
39:10 - Michael Kianmahd: That's one.
39:11 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah.
39:12 - Michael Kianmahd: The second is.
39:19 - Michael Kianmahd: We did not realize, it's kind of the same old thing that we
experience.
39:25 - Michael Kianmahd: We did not realize how complicated this is.
39:30 - Michael Kianmahd: I'm sorry it was 1,100 hours, it could be 2,200 hours.
39:34 - Michael Kianmahd: I just, you know, we just have to do it.
39:37 - Michael Kianmahd: So those are the two types of errors that I wanna avoid.
39:40 - Michael Kianmahd: One is highly offensive, and then the second is highly, highly
offensive.
39:47 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah.
39:49 - Michael Kianmahd: And I don't like, I say that like jokingly, nobody smiled.
39:52 - Michael Kianmahd: So the jokes aren't landing.
39:54 - Michael Kianmahd: I'm gonna go get some coffee.
39:55 - Michael Kianmahd: I'll be right back.
39:58 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah, I guess what I'm trying to say is I would love to completely
eyes closed, sign this and know it's gonna happen and just not worry about it and wait six
months and know that it delivered and it's not perfect, but fantastic.
40:13 - Michael Kianmahd: Very happy, everyone's happy.
40:15 - Michael Kianmahd: especially our team members that use it every day, and our
customers, and our referral partners.
40:21 - Michael Kianmahd: That's really what it's all about at the end of the day.
40:23 - Michael Kianmahd: It's not an intellectual exercise for us.
40:29 - Michael Kianmahd: So that's the assurance I need.
40:32 - Michael Kianmahd: Can you provide that assurance?
40:37 - Adrian Boerstra: I'm gonna just flip it around on you a little bit.
40:39 - Adrian Boerstra: What would you need to get that assurance?
40:41 - Adrian Boerstra: Because at the end of the day, you're contracting us as trusted
professionals, but it's still like this sort of time and material.
40:49 - Adrian Boerstra: So there's risk involved and I absolutely understand the risk.
40:57 - Adrian Boerstra: I don't know, I'm not exactly sure how other than track record, I can
assure you on the risk though.
41:06 - Michael Kianmahd: No, I'm not questioning track record at all.
41:08 - Dave Kaplan: I'm just- And I know you're not like- I think Adrian's point is, I mean, if
we just go brass tacks here, it's, it's time.
41:14 - Dave Kaplan: There's time materials and there's fixed price.
41:17 - Dave Kaplan: And the difference is risk profile and who inherits the risk.
41:20 - Dave Kaplan: So in the time and materials world, uh, just binarily the client and he
hurts the risk price world, the provider inherits the risk.
41:29 - Dave Kaplan: Um, the difference in pricing on those is, uh, a fixed price agreement
would start at a rack rate, uh, our case of two 50 an hour and add a 25% plus buffer depending
on the risk profile.
41:44 - Dave Kaplan: You guys are pretty low risk given what we know of you.
41:47 - Dave Kaplan: So take 275 plus 25% and multiply it out and that would be your number
which should be a lot bigger than this but we would take all the risk and you would go to bed
and know that six months you wake up and this is done.
42:03 - Dave Kaplan: Reversely, the numbers in front of you are, you know, 250 discounted
down to what you have now discount down further based on the larger commit, stratified
rate card and all that.
42:14 - Dave Kaplan: But, you know, to be honest, you go to bed and there's still the risk that
you wake up six months and it came in at, you know, 100 hours short still got delivered or,
you know, different or something less.
42:27 - Dave Kaplan: And there's no there's no other way.
42:28 - Dave Kaplan: There's no other way to describe it and to be around it.
42:31 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah.
42:33 - Michael Kianmahd: Got it.
42:34 - Michael Kianmahd: And your recommendation is this path?
42:37 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah.
42:37 - Dave Kaplan: Yes, and I believe given track record, given what we know, given the
nimbleness and my engagement, A, I don't think there's a single item in this work stream
that is underestimated to the tune of two times.
42:51 - Dave Kaplan: So I'm going to dismiss that as a potential scenario.
42:55 - Dave Kaplan: Is there one that could be 50% off on the smaller side?
43:00 - Dave Kaplan: Sure, because law of numbers, like 40 hours can become 80 in a in the
blink of an eye for a bunch of reasons.
43:07 - Dave Kaplan: But materially, I wouldn't have presented this if I didn't feel it.
43:12 - Dave Kaplan: Edited it and the pricing is extremely attractive and our relationship is
longstanding.
43:17 - Dave Kaplan: So I feel very comfortable here on the level of effort and on the
commercials.
43:25 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah, if I was sitting in your shoes, Michael, and this was my
business, this is how I would go about it.
43:35 - Dave Kaplan: I would not pay the fixed price.
43:36 - Dave Kaplan: I would not assume all the, push all the risk off because
43:39 - Dave Kaplan: you're both individually and professionally, company-wise, you're in a
position
43:45 - Dave Kaplan: to assume some risk because the risk profile here is lower, so I would
not, I wouldn't
43:51 - Dave Kaplan: I wouldn't pay for it to be pushed off to the provider.
43:55 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah.
43:56 - Adrian Boerstra: And from a Faa perspective, it's also in our best interest to do
everything we can, like we have a longstanding relationship with you guys.
44:04 - Adrian Boerstra: So from our standpoint, we already feel an implied incentive and
deep incentive to make sure that we over promise that are under promise over deliver.
44:21 - Michael Kianmahd: I appreciate all that.
44:25 - Michael Kianmahd: So basically the order is for...
44:31 - Adrian Boerstra: Team, I apologize.
44:33 - Adrian Boerstra: I do have to drop right now.
44:35 - Adrian Boerstra: I've got another commitment I've got to get to.
44:39 - Adrian Boerstra: Thank you.
44:40 - Adrian Boerstra: I'm gonna drop off and let you guys wrap up, but thanks very much.
44:44 - Michael Kianmahd: Thank you.
44:45 - Kaleb Dague: So
44:48 - Michael Kianmahd: our order is for.
44:55 - Michael Kianmahd: It looks like a 12 month commitment of axia.
44:59 - Michael Kianmahd: Is how this is drafted.
45:02 - Michael Kianmahd: Do you have the order form somewhere?
45:04 - Kaleb Dague: I do, yeah, the 1 that I sent you was with the annual commit, but there
was the option to do this and my annual commit.
45:12 - Michael Kianmahd: Is it the same price?
45:14 - Kaleb Dague: With the annual commit, the hourly rates were a little bit lower.
45:22 - Kaleb Dague: See, if I go between the two, here's a semi-annual.
45:25 - Kaleb Dague: Just bringing the junior consultant down from 165 to 150, then the
engineer from 115 down to 95.
45:33 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah.
45:35 - Michael Kianmahd: Okay.
45:36 - Michael Kianmahd: I have a copy of this presentation?
45:39 - Kaleb Dague: You should, but it was a couple of weeks ago.
45:41 - Kaleb Dague: So yeah, I can resend it to you, Michael.
45:43 - Michael Kianmahd: I think I got it.
45:46 - Michael Kianmahd: Okay.
45:48 - Kaleb Dague: Then here's the form that I sent a couple of weeks ago too.
45:51 - Kaleb Dague: Again, this is based off Axia Platinum commit for 12 months.
45:59 - Michael Kianmahd: So what does the six month look like?
46:03 - Kaleb Dague: So the six month was Um, in the semi annual commit, the junior
consultants can be about$15 an hour more.
46:14 - Kaleb Dague: I think the engineer was about 20.
46:18 - Kaleb Dague: Uh, dollars an hour more.
46:21 - Kaleb Dague: And here was kind of that comparison.
46:23 - Kaleb Dague: We can keep in mind the axia here is just.
46:26 - Kaleb Dague: Six months of it.
46:29 - Kaleb Dague: So, I think you're ultimately if you go with the annual commit, it's saving
about 7, a over seven grand.
46:36 - Michael Kianmahd: But the other resources are the same?
46:40 - Kaleb Dague: Correct, yeah.
46:43 - Michael Kianmahd: Except, I mean, junior consultants a little bit less, engineers a
little bit less.
46:48 - Kaleb Dague: Correct.
46:49 - Michael Kianmahd: Okay.
46:53 - Michael Kianmahd: Laura, do you think there's room to move resources around to
drive costs down further or no?
47:02 - Laura Dolphin: What do you mean, do you mean like change some of the priorities
to get the junior working know like less senior and junior more engineer.
47:16 - Dave Kaplan: I think the answer is sure, but is it material?
47:21 - Dave Kaplan: Probably not.
47:22 - Dave Kaplan: Will we make best efforts?
47:23 - Dave Kaplan: Yes.
47:24 - Dave Kaplan: And back to the committing commercially under what your internal
budget might be, you would benefit from any of those, whereas you wouldn't if you con-
tracted higher and closer to the actual budget.
47:38 - Michael Kianmahd: So we spend$93,000 and we should reasonably expect that you
guys will deliver by the end of the year all those things on that list.
47:45 - Michael Kianmahd: Is that right?
47:47 - Michael Kianmahd: That's a fair statement.
47:48 - Michael Kianmahd: Okay, I like fair statement.
47:53 - Michael Kianmahd: Okay, I guess Dave and Kayle, do you guys wanna hang on for a
few minutes?
47:58 - Michael Kianmahd: We let Laura go and we talk money.
48:01 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah, I don't need to be here.
48:02 - Laura Dolphin: Thanks guys.
48:03 - Michael Kianmahd: Bye.
48:03 - Michael Kianmahd: Thanks.
48:04 - Laura Dolphin: Have a good one.
48:06 - Michael Kianmahd: Do we wanna dismiss Scribe or do you wanna let Scribe contin-
ue?
48:12 - Dave Kaplan: I don't care either way.
48:13 - Dave Kaplan: Talk to you.
48:14 - Kaleb Dague: I'm taking a little bit more.
