[EXT] FW: Maxim x Faye Planning Transcript
00:02 - Kaleb Dague: Before I have to drive an hour.
00:04 - Michael Kianmahd: I didn't hear you.
00:05 - Michael Kianmahd: There's some background noise.
00:06 - Kaleb Dague: What was that?
00:07 - Kaleb Dague: Yeah, I'm sorry.
00:08 - Kaleb Dague: I'm yeah, I'm at the airport.
00:09 - Kaleb Dague: I just landed a little bit ago.
00:11 - Kaleb Dague: Oh, man.
00:12 - Kaleb Dague: So I thought I'd jump on here before I have to drive home.
00:15 - Michael Kianmahd: Okay.
00:17 - Kaleb Dague: Thanks for meeting with us.
00:18 - Kaleb Dague: I know it was a struggle to get this scheduled, but take over.
00:22 - Kaleb Dague: Laura's meeting here.
00:26 - Kaleb Dague: Laura and Dave should be on.
00:29 - Michael Kianmahd: Hey guys, how are you?
00:36 - Dave Kaplan: Hey Dave, hey, how's it going?
00:38 - Dave Kaplan: Sorry.
00:38 - Dave Kaplan: I mean lunch
00:57 - Michael Kianmahd: Laura, can we knock out Christian really fast?
01:00 - Laura: Do you mind?
01:01 - Laura: Not at all.
01:01 - Laura: If he's training.
01:03 - Michael Kianmahd: Dave and Kayla, I'm sorry if you don't mind.
01:08 - Laura: They don't know what you're talking about.
01:10 - Laura: There's a guy, Christian, joining.
01:11 - Michael Kianmahd: We just need to solve something.
01:12 - Dave Kaplan: Hey, Christian.
01:15 - Michael Kianmahd: Hey, I just wanted to get back to you quickly.
01:17 - Michael Kianmahd: The topic of today was to talk about a bunch of other things, but
Laura did some review of the licensing for us.
01:24 - Michael Kianmahd: I just want you and Laura to kind of confer with each other and
just tell me what we need to do and then send the contract.
01:30 - Michael Kianmahd: I'd be happy to sign it.
01:31 - Michael Kianmahd: I just don't have the data at my fingertips.
01:35 - Michael Kianmahd: You're on mute.
01:40 - Michael Kianmahd: Love that.
01:41 - Christian Luker: Yeah, it's all good.
01:42 - Christian Luker: Sorry, I usually use teams and I'm like, okay, where am I.
01:46 - Christian Luker: Laura, do you want to go first.
01:48 - Christian Luker: Do you want me to kind of explain what works best for you.
01:51 - Laura: I think we need this call time for a different I don't I yeah, can I get back to you?
02:02 - Christian Luker: Yeah, yeah, let's do that.
02:03 - Christian Luker: Or Michael, like I said, it's basically we just want to add advanced
more advanced usage to your account to support the amount of documents you're doing.
02:12 - Christian Luker: Yeah.
02:13 - Christian Luker: And I can put that together and send that over to you.
02:17 - Michael Kianmahd: Um, I just want Laura to validate that what you're asking for is
legitimate and meets our needs.
02:22 - Laura: Okay.
02:23 - Laura: It is, okay.
02:25 - Laura: Yeah, you guys are using the Conga.
02:27 - Laura: So I mean, we can reassess in a few months when we've done the data model
and see if that makes a difference.
02:32 - Laura: But it's like you guys are, you're charged on the usage of it and you're using it.
02:39 - Laura: So I've sent in an email, I'll resurface that to you.
02:42 - Laura: If you want me to talk to the users about like, hey, if they're making mistakes,
things like that.
02:48 - Laura: but ultimately there's not really anything that we're gonna solve today.
02:52 - Michael Kianmahd: Okay, Christian.
02:54 - Christian Luker: This would be an amendment from now until the end of your current
contract.
02:59 - Christian Luker: So pretty much now into December.
03:03 - Christian Luker: So that's what we're doing, we're adding it to December.
03:08 - Christian Luker: And then we'll talk renewal in December.
03:10 - Christian Luker: Does that work, Laura and everyone?
03:13 - Michael Kianmahd: Okay, sounds good.
03:16 - Laura: All right, thank you so much, enjoy.
03:18 - Christian Luker: Thank you.
03:19 - Christian Luker: Bye.
03:20 - Dave Kaplan: Okay, cool.
03:21 - Dave Kaplan: So, Caleb is traveling, so I'll set contacts, and then who's driving the
deck?
03:27 - Dave Kaplan: Is that you, Laura?
03:29 - Dave Kaplan: No.
03:30 - Dave Kaplan: Is it Caleb?
03:31 - Dave Kaplan: It's not me, so it must be Caleb.
03:35 - Michael Kianmahd: It's probably not Michael.
03:36 - Michael Kianmahd: I'm driving the deck, everybody.
03:38 - Michael Kianmahd: All hands on deck.
03:39 - Michael Kianmahd: Okay.
03:41 - Dave Kaplan: I'm going to assume Caleb's driving us, and when I say next time, that's
great, but unless it's quieter, Caleb, I can leave.
03:47 - Kaleb Dague: I think, okay, I mean, tell me if it's a distracting at all, but I was fine.
03:51 - Kaleb Dague: Okay, great.
03:54 - Kaleb Dague: Yeah, my boss in this day afterwards, but a couple slides to kind of go
through.
03:59 - Kaleb Dague: We definitely want to make sure we're cognizant of the list that you
sent over to us.
04:02 - Kaleb Dague: So these are just kind of talking points as we go through this to kind
of talk to her how we'll kind of approach these different things.
04:10 - Kaleb Dague: But the rest of the slides, just kind of go through current engagement
and then two options that we laid out for you.
04:16 - Kaleb Dague: But we can come back to this later if we need to.
04:19 - Kaleb Dague: But first, I guess, just wanted to call out what the current engagement
is.
04:23 - Kaleb Dague: So you're on six-month Axia platinum, 90 hours per quarter.
04:29 - Kaleb Dague: The current quarter right now is running from June 1st until the end of
August.
04:34 - Kaleb Dague: I think as of maybe yesterday or today, it was about like 60 hours of
the 90 hours that you produced already.
04:41 - Kaleb Dague: But Laura, you can correct me if that's way off, but I think that's about
right.
04:47 - Kaleb Dague: And so it's 5,400 per month right now is what you're paying and then
any overage hours were built at 185.
04:55 - Kaleb Dague: And then based on what we had put together with Laura and Adrian,
this is kind of that aggressive timeline to knock out a long list of things over the course of
the next six months.
05:08 - Kaleb Dague: So we broke this out by the different consultants, senior consultant,
that's gonna be Laura and Adrian.
05:15 - Kaleb Dague: We expect about 60 hours of their time each month for the next six
months.
05:20 - Kaleb Dague: And then another consultant, junior consultant, would be 40 hours per
month.
05:25 - Kaleb Dague: And then an engineer, 30 hours per month.
05:29 - Kaleb Dague: So expecting to allocate about 130 total hours per month in what we're
proposing.
05:36 - Kaleb Dague: Any questions on this or Laura or Dave, do you wanna add any context
to this?
05:40 - Michael Kianmahd: I have questions, but I'll hold questions.
06:10 - Kaleb Dague: additional hours available to each quarter.
06:12 - Kaleb Dague: And then with the quarterly Ftes.
06:15 - Kaleb Dague: So on top of the Axia, it would be the additional hours for the senior
consultant, Laura and Adrian.
06:21 - Kaleb Dague: Effective rate there for them is the 185.
06:24 - Kaleb Dague: Shows the list price and the discounted price down to the 185.
06:29 - Kaleb Dague: The junior consultants, 120 hours per month.
06:33 - Kaleb Dague: That rate would be 165 per hour with this option.
06:36 - Kaleb Dague: And then the engineer 115 per hour for this option.
06:42 - Michael Kianmahd: Okay.
06:43 - Kaleb Dague: And then if you would commit to an annual kind of Axia, the rates are
gonna be a little bit lower.
06:52 - Kaleb Dague: So the senior consultant Adrian Laura would stay the same, but then
a junior consultant drop that down to 150 per hour.
07:00 - Kaleb Dague: And then the engineer, we would drop down to$95 an hour.
07:06 - Kaleb Dague: And I just realized that I need to update this total number here.
07:10 - Kaleb Dague: But I'll update that before I send it over to you.
07:13 - Kaleb Dague: And then comparing them kind of against each other, again, this is the
resource for the six months.
07:18 - Kaleb Dague: So with the semi-annual Axia commit, it's 32,400 for the six months,
which is still included in here.
07:26 - Kaleb Dague: And then the senior consultant would stay the same.
07:28 - Kaleb Dague: Junior consultant, the rate goes down a little bit with the Axia annual
commit.
07:32 - Kaleb Dague: And then the engineer, it goes down a little bit with the Axia commit.
07:36 - Kaleb Dague: So in fact, we, yeah, I see.
07:39 - Kaleb Dague: So committing to the Axia for a year is going to lower that price a little
bit for it.
07:46 - Kaleb Dague: So I went through that really, really fast.
07:48 - Kaleb Dague: And those are all the slides that I have.
07:49 - Kaleb Dague: So I'll ask you if you have any questions, Michael, or anything you want
to go back to.
07:54 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah, the most important thing from this that's missing is what
will be achieved in that timeline.
08:01 - Michael Kianmahd: That's where I come in.
08:03 - Michael Kianmahd: Okay.
08:04 - Michael Kianmahd: Because all this is irrelevant unless we achieve what we set out
to achieve.
08:08 - Michael Kianmahd: It's a value issue.
08:10 - Laura: I got it.
08:12 - Laura: Can you see my screen?
08:13 - Michael Kianmahd: It's super small.
08:15 - Laura: It's kind of hard to read.
08:16 - Laura: But you can see it, right?
08:17 - Michael Kianmahd: Okay.
08:18 - Laura: I can see it.
08:19 - Laura: Okay.
08:19 - Laura: So what I did is I took out, based off of what Caleb showed you, it equates to
about 130 hours of people per month.
08:29 - Laura: So like resources, um, I sliced and diced it based off of like how much of me
you need, how much of an engineer, so on and so forth, but combined what he showed you
equals about 130 hours per month.
08:41 - Laura: Okay.
08:42 - Laura: So what I did is I went back in based off of like, knowing that we'll have another
kind of like mini me and then some more of Adrian and more of engineering as they went
back into all the projects and I just did like the hours.
08:56 - Laura: Right.
08:57 - Laura: So I took off a lot of, cause most of the time was originally just me.
09:00 - Laura: So I reduced a lot of that time.
09:02 - Michael Kianmahd: And then I've kind of tried to move things out based on- Your
time, Laura, is that what you just said?
09:09 - Laura: Yeah, well, yeah.
09:11 - Laura: So I've allocated it.
09:12 - Laura: Cause I'm basically, when I spit this out
09:14 - Laura: it gives me like a breakdown in Excel
09:17 - Laura: into hours of like how much of me
09:19 - Laura: cause I only have like a 50, you know
09:21 - Laura: I can only dedicate so much of my time per month
09:24 - Laura: because I've got other engagements and stuff.
09:27 - Laura: So what I did is I used that to say, okay, well, I know I can only give 50 hours
a month or whatever it equates to, it'll be give or take a little bit.
09:37 - Laura: And so I need to basically, sorry, I'm sick always.
09:40 - Laura: I need to like offload a lot of it to the other consultant and that helped me
generate like how much I can actually offload because there's some things that I just can't.
09:51 - Laura: So I'll stay your point person, I'll be on the meetings, I'll be like running all of
your support and stuff like that, which then only leaves X amount of time for the projects.
10:00 - Laura: Okay.
10:01 - Laura: So what I did is I went back into all of these, and I updated, like the different
amounts to basically then spit out and get it where it was like a pretty good balance of like
it had me that would be supported
10:15 - Laura: like I would be able to achieve it and that it was allocated to the different
resources within
10:21 - Laura: different months.
10:22 - Laura: So it's not an easy exercise to do on cold pills.
10:25 - Laura: But anyways, so what I've done here is I've almost got it close.
10:29 - Laura: Okay, so we're over a little bit by what we want to be, which is about 130 hours
per month, which is what Caleb showed you.
10:38 - Laura: So what I was doing yesterday is just kind of like moving things around and
dragging them so that when you stretch things out to give them a longer due date, obviously,
this is going to decrease down to the 130.
10:50 - Laura: So before I do any like dragging and stuff, does that all make sense?
10:57 - Michael Kianmahd: I have ideas and questions.
11:01 - Michael Kianmahd: I'm going to hold, but I follow you.
11:04 - Laura: Okay, cool.
11:05 - Laura: So what you want to do now is, I know like the merging Brtl, scoring enhance-
ments.
11:11 - Michael Kianmahd: There are ways you can zoom, like let me actually, let me move
the screen.
11:15 - Michael Kianmahd: I'll move the screen.
11:16 - Michael Kianmahd: I just, it's going to be looking like I'm distracted.
11:20 - Michael Kianmahd: So that's okay.
11:20 - Michael Kianmahd: Okay
11:23 - Laura: is that better?
11:24 - Michael Kianmahd: I made a little bit bigger.
11:25 - Laura: Yeah, it's perfect.
11:26 - Laura: Yeah, okay, sweet.
11:30 - Laura: Okay, so we've got here merging Br and Tl, scoring enhancements.
11:36 - Laura: I do have Aio enhancements and I ended up just dragging that out because
we'll likely stretch enhancements out over the next sort of like five to six months anyways.
11:46 - Laura: And then we've got duplicate management.
11:49 - Laura: I also stretched that out And what that does is it takes, so for example, if you
have 40 hours, what this tool does is just watch.
11:56 - Laura: So I'm gonna drag here.
11:57 - Laura: It'll just, you see how the average monthly hours is increasing as I like decrease
this and try and deliver things shorter?
12:05 - Laura: What I got it to yesterday was this is pretty, like without, well, we're over, but
without adding more resource or more money, these are like the earliest that those dates
can be achieved.
12:24 - Laura: And this is like, these are pretty much the base things.
12:27 - Laura: So your data model, the org cleanup, the regular support and stuff, that's all
me.
12:31 - Laura: And that's just like the, I think it's like 15 hours per month, duplicates stretched
out and then the merging Trbl scoring stuff.
12:40 - Laura: So I know you want these done by end of July.
12:43 - Laura: That's just, that's not realistic, just simply because like, if you look at the
calendar, There's a lot of stuff to actually get done.
12:51 - Laura: But if we want it done in August, it just means that if you try and drag these
out, this is gonna increase a little bit.
12:58 - Michael Kianmahd: Laura, is the constraint like your time?
13:04 - Michael Kianmahd: Sorry, what was that?
13:05 - Michael Kianmahd: Is the constraint your time?
13:09 - Laura: It is a little bit, but it's not.
13:12 - Laura: It's more so the fact that this is just one of those things that because there's
so much involvement from like multiple people from your team.
13:19 - Laura: Yeah.
13:19 - Laura: And it's like a me plus if we're starting now and assuming that we're starting
like next week with a new resource, it's like there's also just like that person isn't gonna know.
13:30 - Laura: So there's only so much that person can do for the first probably two to three
months.
13:36 - Laura: I have to really drive all of the projects
13:38 - Laura: where I then find pieces of work
13:41 - Laura: like the conga and the docusign
13:43 - Laura: where I'll take that and give it almost like projects
13:45 - Laura: mini project style within a project to a resource
13:48 - Laura: and I can allocate that, but it is still pretty me heavy.
13:52 - Laura: But it's also not just like, even if you had a hundred hours with me, it would
still not be done in July.
13:58 - Laura: Cause it's like, well then we're pretty much out the first week of July.
14:02 - Laura: Then it's like, you have to wait on people to get input.
14:06 - Laura: You have to give them a week to do it.
14:08 - Laura: So it's just like, it's a natural thing.
14:11 - Laura: That being said, we can probably get it done sometime in August.
14:15 - Laura: Yeah, so if you want me, I can like drag those.
14:18 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah, if you don't mind.
14:20 - Michael Kianmahd: So like, cause I have, I don't have a lot of context.
14:23 - Michael Kianmahd: Like this is the first time I've done this, right?
14:26 - Michael Kianmahd: Okay.
14:28 - Michael Kianmahd: So based on other organizations and other engagements and
other things you've worked on in general and your, I don't know, kind of number of times that
we've, how long have you been involved in general with us?
14:45 - Michael Kianmahd: with you, so by nine, 10 months now, I think.
14:50 - Michael Kianmahd: Eight months.
14:51 - Michael Kianmahd: Since the first time we engaged?
14:53 - Laura: I took you guys over in August of last year, like end of August, so.
14:57 - Michael Kianmahd: But even when you did all the discovery?
15:00 - Laura: I, yeah, I honestly don't even really count that because that was just like a
one-off thing.
15:04 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah, I count from August of last year, so it's like a baby.
15:08 - Michael Kianmahd: So relative to other organizations, Like, how pleased are you with
our collective speed of progress?
15:16 - Michael Kianmahd: How what?
15:17 - Michael Kianmahd: How pleased are you with our collective speed of progress?
15:21 - Laura: In terms of what?
15:23 - Laura: Progress on what?
15:25 - Michael Kianmahd: Uh, what we set out to achieve, how long it takes, the amount of
friction we face, the things that go wrong, the availability of our team.
15:36 - Michael Kianmahd: Like just how pleased are you in general relative to working with
other clients?
15:43 - Laura: I mean, I think it will get a lot better if you have a role, like an operations
manager.
15:49 - Michael Kianmahd: That I agree with, but in terms of so far, how pleased are you
relative to other clients?
15:59 - Laura: I don't really know if I want to answer that.
16:01 - Laura: I feel like that's a very personal thing.
16:06 - Dave Kaplan: If you're talking about like...
16:07 - Dave Kaplan: So let's compare it generically to another like a private equity company
that we do work for, M&a firm.
16:17 - Dave Kaplan: I would say that there have been equal fits and starts for a bunch of
different reasons.
16:27 - Dave Kaplan: But that they had more unified decision making because they had other
stakeholders that didn't, you know, the Ceo wasn't the guy that had to be day in day out for
a bunch of reasons.
16:40 - Dave Kaplan: So, the trajectory on that was probably a little.
16:44 - Dave Kaplan: It still is a little faster and probably a little less bumpy.
16:49 - Dave Kaplan: But I don't think you guys, Michael, are far off.
16:54 - Dave Kaplan: I mean, I know you want the answer to be probably some long lines.
16:58 - Dave Kaplan: It could be tremendously better.
17:00 - Dave Kaplan: But I think until you have someone else helping you make those
decisions and you're in this process unification and an overhaul situation and all the other
circumstances in the business, I think your trajectory is pretty good.
17:14 - Dave Kaplan: It needs to be faster by additional resources, but that is going to be
constrained, and I'll say this in two ways, by the Sme, so Laura by name, and then by virtue
by her hours.
17:26 - Dave Kaplan: But I don't think if we could double her tomorrow, the timelines wouldn't
change from what we're presenting generally.
17:34 - Dave Kaplan: Yeah.
17:35 - Dave Kaplan: That was a lot, but does that make sense, what I said?
17:38 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah, it's like high level of the question.
17:40 - Michael Kianmahd: So I guess like, I wanna be both realistic, Realistic, pragmatic,
actually more than two things.
17:49 - Michael Kianmahd: Realistic, pragmatic, but also learn from what we haven't done
well collectively.
17:59 - Michael Kianmahd: So us, Ken, anyone else, like Faye as well, to make sure that we
don't double down on how we're managing things and how we're doing things.
18:11 - Michael Kianmahd: And part of what I think would solve that, Dave, is this kind of
reporting where things are visible and we're not just in the weeds talking about tactical stuff.
18:23 - Michael Kianmahd: We're kind of taking a step back.
18:25 - Michael Kianmahd: You can see a roadmap.
18:26 - Michael Kianmahd: You know what you're trying to achieve.
18:27 - Michael Kianmahd: You've done T-shirt budgeting of timing.
18:30 - Michael Kianmahd: I think the second layer to that is the conversation I had with
Ross, which was some of the friction we face as a company was the turnover that we had
servicing our accounts.
18:41 - Michael Kianmahd: So now part of the friction today is, quote unquote, the team's
availability, which obviously Laura is taking a big leadership role in.
18:49 - Michael Kianmahd: So a lot of my questions are like, is there anything we can toggle?
18:55 - Michael Kianmahd: Or is there anything Kin, not Kin, sorry.
18:58 - Michael Kianmahd: I was just on a Kin call, Fay can do to accommodate what Maxim
needs to drive productivity faster?
19:11 - Dave Kaplan: Yeah, so I think the conveyance of value and the driving of productivity
faster.
19:15 - Dave Kaplan: So the conveyance of value, bringing it out of the Powerpoints into this
tool, which Adrian gets back tomorrow and he'll catch up over the weekend, and he'll extend
this tool so that transparency and inclusion is at an all-time high relative to the Faye-maxim
relationship.
19:33 - Dave Kaplan: So let's assume that's in place.
19:36 - Dave Kaplan: That tool represents a roadmap and a timeline.
19:39 - Dave Kaplan: And the timeline that we just presented, I believe, is aggressive, but
realistic and predicated on real world numbers with roles and names attached to those roles.
19:49 - Dave Kaplan: So it's not like a theoretical.
19:53 - Dave Kaplan: And I do think that what's different tomorrow than yesterday is
broadening the Faye team from primarily, if not exclusively Laura.
20:04 - Dave Kaplan: You know, inclusion on the junior consultant so that we do more quicker
her direction.
20:09 - Dave Kaplan: I'll press Adrian to become a little bit more present.
20:14 - Dave Kaplan: And then I'll stay a lot closer.
20:17 - Dave Kaplan: So, with the 6, whether it's 6 or 12, the 12 will be financially beneficial
to you and allows better resource planning.
20:23 - Dave Kaplan: But, you know, if you want 6, that's fine.
20:25 - Dave Kaplan: But, you know, we have a tighter right wrong and different tighter.
20:30 - Dave Kaplan: Portfolio management concept, a better program management view
and a better project plan that I think we have, at least since I've been involved in the equation.
20:41 - Michael Kianmahd: I agree with that.
20:42 - Michael Kianmahd: I mean, this is this is the way I prefer to see information and make
decisions.
20:47 - Michael Kianmahd: Otherwise, I'm just like, in the chaos of random small things.
20:51 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah.
20:52 - Michael Kianmahd: Okay, what if you we have 9 minutes left?
20:57 - Michael Kianmahd: What is it?
20:59 - Michael Kianmahd: Is there anything else you wanted to cover at a higher level or do
you mind if I just go through a bunch of questions?
21:05 - Dave Kaplan: The latter, fire away.
21:08 - Michael Kianmahd: Okay, do you think it would make sense to go through each
of these value streams and kind of take a second look at timing and give me a chance to
challenge them again?
21:21 - Michael Kianmahd: To make sure we're getting it right, because we did that once
pretty quickly.
21:24 - Michael Kianmahd: I think that was last week or the week before, I don't remember.
21:28 - Dave Kaplan: Unless you believe in them and buy into them, then they don't mean
much.
21:35 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah, the only problem is I'm not the person doing the work and
I don't.
21:42 - Michael Kianmahd: Have, like, a strong enough acumen to to, like.
21:46 - Michael Kianmahd: No, but what I can tell you is, like, you know, if you, uh, Caleb,
could you pull up the slide?
21:54 - Dave Kaplan: He's a hold on I'm in charge of the deck now.
21:56 - Dave Kaplan: So let me see here.
22:01 - Michael Kianmahd: You guys, yes, this controlling the deck is such a personal
problem.
22:06 - Dave Kaplan: Isn't it?
22:06 - Dave Kaplan: Yeah.
22:07 - Michael Kianmahd: Do you see it slide 2, please?
22:10 - Dave Kaplan: Okay, here's a problem.
22:13 - Dave Kaplan: I'm Google meets on.
22:14 - Michael Kianmahd: 1 tab and okay, there you go.
22:17 - Michael Kianmahd: You're crushing it.
22:19 - Michael Kianmahd: This is how I think about it.
22:23 - Michael Kianmahd: So, impact value costs, accountability, priority, dependencies,
risk.
22:30 - Michael Kianmahd: So those are kind of the variables in my mind that I'll think about
in terms of deciding to do something or not to do something, or prioritize something or not
prioritize something, or we'd like to do that, but we have to do this first.
22:43 - Michael Kianmahd: So I feel like I personally rely heavily on Laura to educate me on
these line items.
22:50 - Michael Kianmahd: So going forward, I want all these things to be super clear to me
so I can make investment decisions.
22:56 - Michael Kianmahd: Is that fair?
22:58 - Laura: Yeah, for sure.
22:59 - Laura: I think the only thing missing from our tool right now is the dependencies,
right?
23:04 - Laura: We can add something to classify risk, but that really just comes in the priority,
I believe.
23:10 - Dave Kaplan: And to be fair, dependencies can always be stated.
23:14 - Dave Kaplan: It's just representing the visual impact, which I've got that on the
backlog, but not like we don't know the dependencies, just a visualization thereof.
23:24 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah.
23:24 - Michael Kianmahd: Ok.
23:26 - Michael Kianmahd: All right.
23:29 - Michael Kianmahd: So I just wanted to call attention to that.
23:31 - Michael Kianmahd: It sounds like you guys agree and you're bought into it.
23:33 - Michael Kianmahd: And you've made meaningful steps in the last couple of weeks
to visually present it, for which I'm grateful.
23:39 - Michael Kianmahd: So thank you very much.
23:40 - Michael Kianmahd: I think the next layer to that is, Laura, if you go back to your value
stream.
23:46 - Michael Kianmahd: The planner?
23:49 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah.
23:49 - Michael Kianmahd: Yes.
23:50 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah, exactly.
23:51 - Michael Kianmahd: Github, right?
23:53 - Laura: Yeah, it's just in like dev mode right now.
23:56 - Michael Kianmahd: What's that?
23:58 - Laura: It's like this like development mode basically, but yeah.
24:01 - Michael Kianmahd: Okay, can you go to the top?
24:04 - Michael Kianmahd: Yep.
24:06 - Michael Kianmahd: Okay, so the concept of like, how do we figure out how to budget?
24:11 - Michael Kianmahd: What's the monthly contract?
24:12 - Michael Kianmahd: I would imagine based on what we're trying to do, some months
could be way more than 130 hours.
24:18 - Laura: Do you agree?
24:19 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah.
24:20 - Michael Kianmahd: There's gonna be like peaks and valleys.
24:21 - Michael Kianmahd: Like one month might be a high, one might feel low.
24:24 - Michael Kianmahd: Yes, 100%.
24:26 - Michael Kianmahd: Okay, do we face Fae resource constraints in those peaks?
24:34 - Dave Kaplan: Depending on one of the roles.
24:37 - Dave Kaplan: So senior consultant, I would have to say yes, because it's Adrian and
it's Laura, and Laura does have a finite cap.
24:46 - Dave Kaplan: On the junior consultant, on the if ever invoked a senior engineer, And
then on the engineer, I have to go look on contract.
24:54 - Dave Kaplan: I can up the contract, but the answer should be no for the rest and yes
for the senior consultant potential.
24:59 - Michael Kianmahd: Okay, so let's focus in on the senior consultant for which Laura
historically has fulfilled that role.
25:05 - Michael Kianmahd: One of my sensitivities, given how I've learned how things work
with Faye or like our experience with Faye is resources shifting or resources not being
available.
25:21 - Dave Kaplan: Is there a way?
25:23 - Dave Kaplan: She'd be committed to X of the 60 hours.
25:25 - Dave Kaplan: We would have a minimum commit for Laura.
25:28 - Laura: I'm not going anywhere, neither is Adrian.
25:30 - Dave Kaplan: It's the max.
25:32 - Dave Kaplan: It's flexing them above the min commit on short notice where I'm being
honest about a concern.
25:37 - Michael Kianmahd: Totally get it.
25:40 - Michael Kianmahd: And like that Ross, I don't remember even when we talked, but
it was a really long time ago, but it was kind of on the same topic with a lot less definition, a
lot less knowledge.
25:55 - Michael Kianmahd: I think Faye had about our needs and what was possible, and I
think we were a lot less aligned back then, but we have basically the same problem today.
26:02 - Michael Kianmahd: So I guess what I would ask is
26:04 - Michael Kianmahd: is there any way that you could solve that problem
26:09 - Michael Kianmahd: so Laura doesn't feel constrained on her time
26:15 - Michael Kianmahd: on her time and feel this like friction where it's like it's going to
cost everyone a lot more time
26:21 - Michael Kianmahd: Getting the other person up to speed
26:23 - Michael Kianmahd: It's like you know these lawyers that will bring in junior partners
and like you get billed for hours on both sides
26:28 - Michael Kianmahd: You get billed when you talk to them then they bill for talking
between each other then they bill
26:32 - Michael Kianmahd: For the work they do then they bill you for checking the work of
the other person all of a sudden something
26:36 - Michael Kianmahd: That's one hour is ten hours.
26:38 - Michael Kianmahd: I want to avoid that almost at all times All costs.
26:41 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah.
26:42 - Michael Kianmahd: If that's reasonable.
26:43 - Michael Kianmahd: So I don't want to do that.
26:44 - Michael Kianmahd: The only path forward that I've seen achieving that.
26:48 - Michael Kianmahd: Is having like kind of our main person who historically is Laura,
be more available to us.
26:54 - Michael Kianmahd: That's the only way that I can think of achieving that.
26:56 - Michael Kianmahd: And I think that's more efficient.
26:57 - Dave Kaplan: Right.
27:00 - Dave Kaplan: It's more efficient and you don't have the wrong context.
27:03 - Dave Kaplan: But.
27:04 - Dave Kaplan: I do not have a backfill opportunity at the other clients that Laura is on
right now for the very same reasons that you wouldn't want me backfilling Laura and going
down on yours.
27:16 - Michael Kianmahd: Have they communicated that to you?
27:18 - Dave Kaplan: They have very expressly.
27:21 - Michael Kianmahd: You haven't been that, this is interesting Laura.
27:25 - Michael Kianmahd: Laura is highly utilized.
27:27 - Dave Kaplan: Sorry.
27:28 - Laura: I'm working all hours of the night Michael.
27:31 - Michael Kianmahd: You need to learn to say no to other people, not us.
27:34 - Laura: I have tried and I will be offload.
27:38 - Laura: I have to literally to fulfill this.
27:40 - Laura: I already am skimming down on other accounts.
27:43 - Laura: I'm kind of have to bring other resources in and I will do that because I can't
work 60 hour weeks.
27:51 - Laura: But it is also I do like for my own personal general like I do like a mix.
28:00 - Laura: I'm not going to lie to you.
28:03 - Laura: I like a mix.
28:03 - Laura: I like my other clients.
28:05 - Laura: I like to have experience, not just in a single.
28:09 - Laura: So there's also that.
28:11 - Laura: But I can promise you that the way that I go about this, I will make sure that
I'm giving the person.
28:19 - Laura: So with an engineer, this is like, this hasn't changed.
28:22 - Laura: This has always been, I already hand over work.
28:25 - Laura: The main person that I am going to be using for this is really good.
28:31 - Laura: And we have a pretty efficient way of getting things back and forth.
28:34 - Laura: And I'll continue to do that.
28:36 - Laura: So I do a lot of like little zoom clips that just cut out the need of like reading
and going back and forth and asking questions.
28:42 - Laura: And he does pretty much the same to me and it's just really efficient.
28:46 - Laura: I will do that method with the same consultant.
28:49 - Laura: But the way that think of this person like they're not They might be junior, but
they've also had a long history of like with Salesforce, with the product suite.
29:00 - Laura: So we've looked for like, we're getting the people who have experience with
like Docusign or Conga.
29:06 - Laura: So I'm going to be giving them little mini projects within the overarching project
that I'm doing.
29:13 - Laura: And if need be, I will put them in contact with like Jay and Charles and just
say, run with it.
29:19 - Laura: and almost just cuts me out.
29:21 - Laura: And then I'll just be there if they have issues or questions or to see the end
product and make sure that it's good.
29:27 - Michael Kianmahd: I understand.
29:28 - Michael Kianmahd: Ok.
29:30 - Michael Kianmahd: So are you guys available in an hour?
29:32 - Michael Kianmahd: Because I have a hard stop right now, unfortunately.
29:34 - Dave Kaplan: I have a hard stop right now.
29:35 - Dave Kaplan: I'm not available.
29:36 - Dave Kaplan: I mean, I can do tomorrow.
29:37 - Dave Kaplan: I can do Monday.
29:38 - Dave Kaplan: But I go back to back after this.
29:42 - Dave Kaplan: But you guys can continue the conversation without me.
29:44 - Dave Kaplan: But Caleb sounds like he's boarding as well, right?
29:47 - Laura: Yeah.
29:48 - Laura: We have the Ken.
29:49 - Laura: Oh, I'm free after the call with Ken.
29:52 - Michael Kianmahd: If you want to continue with me.
29:54 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah, let's do that.
29:55 - Michael Kianmahd: Caleb, could you email me the presentation and then I'll just give
Laura all my notes and maybe she can confirm with you guys on the back of that.
30:02 - Dave Kaplan: And then if we need to talk again, we can talk again.
30:03 - Dave Kaplan: Yeah, so on that call, just why don't you guys go through
30:08 - Dave Kaplan: him challenging the value streams
30:10 - Dave Kaplan: and you as the technical person saying why it is that
30:14 - Dave Kaplan: so that you absorb what Laura is saying
30:18 - Dave Kaplan: and believe it at the end of the day
30:20 - Dave Kaplan: and then we're past that point
30:22 - Dave Kaplan: on the value stream timelines.
30:24 - Dave Kaplan: Then you'll have the presentation, you and I can circle back on pricing.
30:28 - Dave Kaplan: As far as the capacity goes, the only other considerations you guys can
talk through is Laura number two in the senior consultant role.
30:36 - Dave Kaplan: I don't know who that is by name right now, if that's even possible, But
I don't see Laura going up in the next 6 months.
30:48 - Dave Kaplan: Okay, I got it.
30:49 - Dave Kaplan: Okay, cool.
30:50 - Dave Kaplan: I appreciate your time and let us know if we need more group time.
30:53 - Michael Kianmahd: And we'll get that done as well.
30:56 - Michael Kianmahd: Okay.
30:56 - Michael Kianmahd: Just thankful for the time.
30:58 - Michael Kianmahd: Everybody.
30:58 - Dave Kaplan: Thank you very much.
30:59 - Kaleb Dague: Great.
31:00 - Laura: Thanks.
31:00 - Michael Kianmahd: Yes.
31:01 - Laura: Bye.
31:03 - Michael Kianmahd: Talk to you in a bit.
