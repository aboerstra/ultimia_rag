Maxim x Faye Planning Transcript
00:01 - Michael Kianmahd: Michael.
00:05 - Charles Salanga: Chorus Notetaker and Spiky Scribe with us today.
00:09 - Michael Kianmahd: Our dear friends.
00:12 - Michael Kianmahd: Grateful to have them.
00:15 - Michael Kianmahd: We shouldn't praise them too much because I think using too
much memory is also bad.
00:27 - Michael Kianmahd: Hey, Kaleb.
00:31 - Michael Kianmahd: Hey, Michael, how's it going?
00:32 - Michael Kianmahd: Good, how are you?
00:33 - Kaleb Dague: Good.
00:36 - Kaleb Dague: Just me on Thursday.
00:37 - Kaleb Dague: Nobody else yet?
00:39 - Michael Kianmahd: Not yet, just Charles.
00:42 - Michael Kianmahd: Okay.
00:43 - Michael Kianmahd: Awesome.
00:45 - Kaleb Dague: Charles, nice to meet you.
00:48 - Charles Salanga: Nice to meet you, Caleb.
00:55 - Kaleb Dague: I'll miss his Laura.
00:56 - Kaleb Dague: Make sure she's joined.
01:01 - Michael Kianmahd: Tell her it's 1000 hours for every minute.
01:04 - Michael Kianmahd: She's late.
01:06 - Kaleb Dague: We should work like that, right?
01:10 - Michael Kianmahd: Nice.
01:11 - Michael Kianmahd: I heard something really funny you guys.
01:13 - Michael Kianmahd: But actually probably Laura should hear this too.
01:17 - Michael Kianmahd: Hey, Laura.
01:20 - Michael Kianmahd: You're on mute.
01:23 - Laura: Thanks.
01:23 - Laura: Hey.
01:25 - Michael Kianmahd: I heard something funny.
01:27 - Michael Kianmahd: You have kids, right?
01:29 - Kaleb Dague: I do.
01:30 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah.
01:30 - Michael Kianmahd: So I was the oldest of four and there was like five year gaps
between all of us.
01:34 - Michael Kianmahd: And then the youngest two were like twins.
01:37 - Michael Kianmahd: So they're the same age and they're always like fighting over
stuff.
01:40 - Michael Kianmahd: So like I found myself negotiating a lot.
01:43 - Michael Kianmahd: I saw a really funny video you guys might, you know, find some
value in.
01:48 - Michael Kianmahd: So if the kids were fighting, you basically use the parent and you
basically auction chore hours.
01:56 - Michael Kianmahd: So you have them settle, like whoever wins this argument has
to pay in chore hours.
02:03 - Michael Kianmahd: So we'll go with what you want.
02:04 - Michael Kianmahd: You get to keep the toy, but you have to invest 20 hours of dish
washing or whatever.
02:10 - Michael Kianmahd: Have them learn how to negotiate between the two of them and
you're set.
02:15 - Kaleb Dague: I love it.
02:16 - Kaleb Dague: Teach them a lesson.
02:17 - Laura: I feel like I already do that and mine are only three and five, so.
02:25 - Michael Kianmahd: You have a hard bargain.
02:27 - Laura: Yeah.
02:28 - Laura: Yeah, you gotta start young.
02:30 - Adrian Boerstra: I'm looking at my camera here, so you're not looking at my side
profile.
02:33 - Michael Kianmahd: It's a good profile, Adrian.
02:34 - Adrian Boerstra: and work on it.
02:38 - Michael Kianmahd: And talks, it's good.
02:46 - Laura: Charles is in attendance today.
02:48 - Laura: I'm assuming there is a specific topic or you just a pretty face in the room
today, Charles.
02:58 - Charles Salanga: I'm just a face.
02:59 - Charles Salanga: I'll take the pretty out of it, but yeah, just face.
03:02 - Charles Salanga: I think Jay is joining us too.
03:04 - Laura: Yeah, okay.
03:05 - Laura: Is there a specific reason?
03:07 - Laura: Are you guys just going to be joining from now on?
03:08 - Laura: Because that makes sense.
03:11 - Michael Kianmahd: No, we wanted to cover an issue with the intake tool.
03:16 - Michael Kianmahd: Okay, also highlight dupes.
03:19 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah, do you want to explain the issue?
03:28 - Charles Salanga: Oh, yeah, the issue, yeah, the issue is at the intake level, there's
certain validations that aren't being patched anymore.
03:37 - Charles Salanga: And it's like the only way for us to actually go through the entire
intake process is to not use those validations.
03:45 - Charles Salanga: So you know, we're seeing things that we haven't seen before, get
it done, like go through to intake form a lot quicker than if they were to do it manually.
03:54 - Charles Salanga: But what happens is that they're having to check afterwards, which,
you know, the time that we saved, you know, some of that comes back to Qc, the work that's
been put in.
04:03 - Charles Salanga: So, they're saving time, but it could be better.
04:06 - Laura: Okay.
04:07 - Laura: So, I am probably going to need to like see this.
04:10 - Laura: Michael, I invited Adrienne here today because we want to talk about like the
value streams and the formatting and stuff.
04:16 - Laura: Do you want me to circle back with Jay and Charles and Louis on this like
separately?
04:23 - Laura: Because I'm probably going to need to like talk through some of that with
them.
04:25 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah.
04:26 - Michael Kianmahd: Wanted to quickly flag it for you.
04:28 - Michael Kianmahd: So that would be great if you could do that.
04:30 - Laura: Yeah.
04:31 - Laura: Can I poke you guys when I'm done here and we can jump on a meet after?
04:37 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah.
04:38 - Laura: Okay.
04:39 - Michael Kianmahd: Thanks guys.
04:41 - Michael Kianmahd: Do you think this content would be helpful for them to see as
well?
04:45 - Adrian Boerstra: I feel like right now, Michael would be good to run.
04:49 - Adrian Boerstra: I don't want you and them to see the same thing.
04:53 - Adrian Boerstra: Some of the same ideas that we're proposing at the same time.
04:55 - Adrian Boerstra: Rather, you kind of have a chance to look it over and then make
some decisions and then go.
05:04 - Michael Kianmahd: Okay, all right guys, thank you for being on in short notice.
05:07 - Michael Kianmahd: Thanks, I'll poke you in about 20.
05:09 - Laura: All right, okay Adrian, do you want me to share screen or would you like to?
05:20 - Adrian Boerstra: You go ahead and share your screen and I'll kind of talk through.
05:25 - Laura: Okay, do you want to start with the value streams or the steering committee?
05:31 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah, well, Brent, you can go right in on the value.
05:38 - Adrian Boerstra: Well, yeah, we talked about the value streams, so I'll tie that right in
and we'll go right into that sort of that meeting style.
05:47 - Laura: Okay.
05:48 - Adrian Boerstra: So, Michael, I wanted to kind of just propose something to you in
terms of how we move forward just from a governance perspective that I think is going to
be really helpful and I just wanted to get your take on it.
06:06 - Adrian Boerstra: So we talked about the value streams last week and it sounded like
we got some validation on those and I feel like we may have had a conversation like this a
long time ago and just before we ever really got going on everything.
06:22 - Adrian Boerstra: So some of this might be repeat, but I think I may have, have I
referred to Eos at all with you?
06:28 - Adrian Boerstra: Entrepreneurial Operating System, Traction, does that any of that
ring a bell?
06:34 - Michael Kianmahd: I don't know if you've mentioned it, but a couple of people have
mentioned it to me over the last like year.
06:40 - Adrian Boerstra: Okay.
06:41 - Michael Kianmahd: I get to read the book, I get hit up by like Eos implementers like
once a week.
06:48 - Adrian Boerstra: Okay, so I'm gonna save you some money.
06:51 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah.
06:52 - Adrian Boerstra: And I'll just, I'm gonna explain, because this is, this is the, what I'm
pulling all of this from.
06:58 - Michael Kianmahd: Okay.
06:58 - Adrian Boerstra: Suggesting that we use this structure within the scope of, at least
within the steering committee.
07:06 - Adrian Boerstra: And this will, the idea here is that this will create a naturally occurring
roadmap for us that will be aligned with the business, will be based on performance goals
that you have within the business.
07:18 - Adrian Boerstra: And you'll have owners within the business over each value stream.
07:23 - Adrian Boerstra: And so one of the dynamics that I know you don't like, is when you
have to use a pull approach to get people in, and have to then explain why something is
important.
07:37 - Adrian Boerstra: You know
07:39 - Adrian Boerstra: that we're doing or try and back it up you what you're looking
07:41 - Adrian Boerstra: for is people within your organization to take ownership over
07:46 - Adrian Boerstra: you know, performance metrics, et cetera, and then to take owner-
ship over the solutions
07:50 - Adrian Boerstra: and then leverage us as a, as one of the ways that can be valued.
07:56 - Adrian Boerstra: Would, is that pretty accurate?
07:58 - Michael Kianmahd: Yes.
07:59 - Adrian Boerstra: So, so the concept here is if we take, I touched on the value streams
last week, which sort of, it seems like it's not too hard to sort of map that to some aspects
of the org structure.
08:11 - Adrian Boerstra: But the idea would be within the steering committee that we have
people that are assigned to each value stream.
08:18 - Adrian Boerstra: And then when we come into this, and then each value stream, we
talked at a high level about some of the metrics.
08:24 - Adrian Boerstra: And I think that there would be another meeting where you would
work collaboratively with that team to establish what the right metrics are for each value
stream.
08:35 - Adrian Boerstra: But if you imagine having a leader within the organization respon-
sible by value stream, then this is, I'm following this is 100% the Eos template for running
what they refer to as the level 10 meeting.
08:51 - Adrian Boerstra: So in the level 10 meeting, you start with, there's gonna be a few
segments and they're all very short.
08:59 - Adrian Boerstra: So these are dry, no explanations, no back and forth, other than
like the segue where everyone comes in and says, oh, this is what I did on the weekend or
whatever.
09:09 - Adrian Boerstra: A little bit of small talk, everyone gives like a personal success, a
business success, and then you're into the meeting.
09:15 - Adrian Boerstra: And the very first thing that you do is you review a scorecard.
09:20 - Adrian Boerstra: So do you have that, yeah, the spreadsheet handy things.
09:23 - Adrian Boerstra: So in your scorecard, the category, the very first column, I've got
sales, marketing, support, finance.
09:30 - Adrian Boerstra: In our case, what that's gonna be is our value streams.
09:33 - Adrian Boerstra: So this could be application intake, could be credit, but whatever our
value streams are, we would pop into these categories.
09:43 - Adrian Boerstra: And then you've got your metrics in column B, which are going to
be the metrics that we're measuring for each one.
09:49 - Adrian Boerstra: Generally, we want to have for this steering committee, you can
have more metrics overall within each department, but at the steering committee level, we
probably only want to have one or two metrics per value stream to keep it manageable.
10:08 - Adrian Boerstra: There would be a process where we go through and decide what
those metrics are that are important.
10:13 - Adrian Boerstra: We can get into best practices around the metrics.
10:16 - Adrian Boerstra: Generally, it's like leading indicators so that we're not waiting until
we're already in the mire to figure out that we're there.
10:23 - Adrian Boerstra: We focus on leading indicators and these are things that we
measure on a weekly basis.
10:29 - Adrian Boerstra: And then everybody reports within this, the context of this meeting
on these metrics.
10:34 - Adrian Boerstra: But what's important here is you may not even own any of these
metrics, Michael.
10:39 - Adrian Boerstra: You might own one or something, but the idea is that this is your
team and your committee members that own these metrics.
10:46 - Adrian Boerstra: And they're the ones responsible for performance on them, and
they're responsible for, we establish what our goal is.
10:54 - Adrian Boerstra: And then as we fill those out within this, we start to see where we're
going week to week.
10:59 - Adrian Boerstra: Are we trending better?
11:01 - Adrian Boerstra: And it's actually important that this isn't just an automated score-
card that we just pull up.
11:09 - Adrian Boerstra: I've found it helpful to actually have people, you know, in the scope
of this meeting, report on these metrics.
11:14 - Adrian Boerstra: We don't get into discussions about them, but if we start to see a
trend of somebody's missing the mark, you know, week after week, then we note that down
and then later in the meeting, we're gonna come back to it.
11:28 - Adrian Boerstra: But at this point, it's pretty dry.
11:29 - Adrian Boerstra: We report on the scorecard and on all of the metrics here and each
one of the people who are responsible.
11:36 - Adrian Boerstra: So every metric has an owner in the organization.
11:42 - Adrian Boerstra: So let's move on to the next.
11:44 - Adrian Boerstra: Any questions about that, Michael?
11:46 - Michael Kianmahd: I don't.
11:48 - Adrian Boerstra: All right.
11:48 - Adrian Boerstra: So then the next stage is called rock review.
11:53 - Adrian Boerstra: And, you know, the term rock comes from sort of the metaphor that
11:58 - Adrian Boerstra: hey, if you, that's actually not really a metaphor, sort of it is
12:01 - Adrian Boerstra: but if you take a whole bunch of sand, put it in a glass, fill it with
water
12:08 - Adrian Boerstra: and then try to put rocks in it, they won't fit.
12:11 - Adrian Boerstra: But if you pour the little things in after the big things, you know, then
you make sure that you get all of the things that are higher priority.
12:18 - Adrian Boerstra: So Rocs are about each value stream leader is going to select.
12:24 - Adrian Boerstra: Again, they can work with you to select what they are, but they're
going to have every quarter Rocs.
12:30 - Adrian Boerstra: These are things that they need to do and accomplish in order to
be able to move forward as a department or as a value stream.
12:40 - Adrian Boerstra: So at any given time throughout the year, on each value stream, they
should have measurables that they're trying to accomplish in the form of rocks.
12:52 - Adrian Boerstra: And these get identified.
12:54 - Adrian Boerstra: And at this point in the meeting agenda, again, no real discussion
about each of the rocks.
13:00 - Adrian Boerstra: Everybody just reports on whether they are on track or off track on
the rocks that they have set out for that quarter.
13:09 - Adrian Boerstra: And if they're off track, then we can again note that for later in the
meeting in what we call the Ids section.
13:19 - Adrian Boerstra: But they're just reporting, so it's pretty dry at this stage.
13:24 - Adrian Boerstra: The next section of the meeting is headlines.
13:29 - Adrian Boerstra: And headlines is not necessarily actionable information, but it's
something that the team wants to share with the rest of the steering committee.
13:38 - Adrian Boerstra: It's not something that we need everybody's input in on to solve or
whatever, but it's like, hey, somebody's going to be off and this affects us in some way.
13:48 - Adrian Boerstra: You know, client A, you know, we just did all, we rolled that thing out
for Penske and we're getting really great feedback, you know, so, you know, kudos to the
team.
13:58 - Adrian Boerstra: Those are headlines and so people will just run through what their
headlines are and what they want to share with the rest of the team.
14:06 - Adrian Boerstra: And then we get into to-dos.
14:09 - Adrian Boerstra: And this is where you, everybody is, here we should already have
coming into this meeting a list of the tasks that were agreed upon in the last meeting.
14:18 - Adrian Boerstra: And people report on whether they've got them done or not.
14:22 - Adrian Boerstra: Again it's pretty much yes or no.
14:25 - Adrian Boerstra: Is it done?
14:26 - Adrian Boerstra: Is it not done?
14:28 - Adrian Boerstra: And then we get to the Ids.
14:30 - Adrian Boerstra: And Ids stands for identify, discuss, and solve.
14:35 - Adrian Boerstra: And during the week, people can go into the system and they can
add in the things that they want to discuss in the upcoming meeting.
14:44 - Adrian Boerstra: If we have been missing items on the scorecard or if we're off track
on a rock or our to-dos are not getting done, those all can be things that we put into the Ids
section as something to solve.
14:57 - Adrian Boerstra: And then when we get to this section, we agree with the rest of the
team, hey, what are the most important things to solve in today's meeting?
15:04 - Adrian Boerstra: those to the top, discuss those three items, and when the person
who raised that as an issue says, yeah, I'm solved on that, then you move on to the next one.
15:15 - Adrian Boerstra: And so this way you're actually not just discussing things and then
meandering through different topics.
15:23 - Adrian Boerstra: Discussing it and solving it means we're going to have a breakout
meeting to get into it
15:27 - Adrian Boerstra: more detail because it's going to take more time than we can put
into this meeting, or
15:31 - Adrian Boerstra: it's issuing to-dos to some of the people on the team
15:34 - Adrian Boerstra: who are going to take action items
15:35 - Adrian Boerstra: or it's we've discussed it
15:37 - Adrian Boerstra: and we don't need to bring it up again.
15:39 - Adrian Boerstra: But either way, we solve those.
15:41 - Adrian Boerstra: And then you get to the end of the meeting, and at the end of the
meeting, everybody rates the meeting out of 10.
15:47 - Adrian Boerstra: And that's just like everything I just discussed is just vanilla Eos
meeting style.
15:57 - Adrian Boerstra: So what I like about this for our scenario is that this helps to put
leaders, building leaders within the organization who will be in charge of different metrics,
taking ownership for those metrics, and being account, they're being held to account to the
metrics and if they're hitting the metrics all good.
16:16 - Adrian Boerstra: all good.
16:17 - Adrian Boerstra: But you might say, Hey, if we've never missed a metric over the last
year, you might go, maybe we're not challenging ourselves enough, and we should get a little
bit better.
16:27 - Adrian Boerstra: But if we're missing it repeatedly, do we have a good strategy in
place?
16:32 - Adrian Boerstra: So you can help to coach and urge the team to set their goals right,
and the metrics around the right thing, but they're the ones who got to take ownership over
that performance.
16:42 - Adrian Boerstra: And then, so what that means is when we are looking at taking
action items from a systems perspective to help people to solve things and solve challenges,
we start to – you can kind of see how lining up across value streams what their rocks are.
17:02 - Adrian Boerstra: The technology will ultimately play not – maybe not a central in all
of them, but in some cases may be a central role in supporting the rocks that they set out
for the next quarter.
17:17 - Adrian Boerstra: And we start for the system that's built fully around company
performance.
17:22 - Adrian Boerstra: What do you think of the concept?
17:27 - Michael Kianmahd: I think conceptually it makes a lot of sense.
17:30 - Michael Kianmahd: I think it's outside of the scope of what I was thinking for what
we needed for Faye's purposes.
17:36 - Michael Kianmahd: And kind of what we were talking about was like output and value
of projects that Faye is handling.
17:46 - Adrian Boerstra: Yep.
17:47 - Michael Kianmahd: So, okay.
17:49 - Michael Kianmahd: The other sort of like thing is a lot of the things that we're working
on together.
17:54 - Michael Kianmahd: They're not like one person's like leadership
17:57 - Michael Kianmahd: It's not possible for one person to be the leader
18:01 - Michael Kianmahd: It's kind of like co-leadership
18:04 - Michael Kianmahd: Mm-hmm because I think the way the business was run and one
of the things that I'm kind of trying to change
18:12 - Michael Kianmahd: Is there is like kind of silos between Bl and Tr so Tr knows nothing
about Bl knows nothing about Tr
18:19 - Michael Kianmahd: We're kind of separately.
18:20 - Michael Kianmahd: There's no scale.
18:21 - Michael Kianmahd: We have different form documents.
18:23 - Michael Kianmahd: We have different processes.
18:24 - Michael Kianmahd: We have different rules So to the outside world like a lot of that
stuff was very complicated.
18:28 - Michael Kianmahd: So like
18:30 - Michael Kianmahd: for like the maximum subject
18:33 - Michael Kianmahd: Matter expert you needed one member of each side
18:36 - Michael Kianmahd: to kind of put
18:38 - Michael Kianmahd: The best of both worlds on a piece of paper eliminate all the stuff
that doesn't matter and then go with the roll forward plan
18:46 - Michael Kianmahd: But what I find myself doing is like there's you know
18:50 - Michael Kianmahd: We've got talented experienced people, but the only executive is
me that is doing this stuff.
18:57 - Michael Kianmahd: So I basically chose to dive deep on all this stuff with people,
how to get them and challenge them and kind of see where they're at and how they manage
things and level of talent they have to kind of lead projects and that kind of thing.
19:14 - Michael Kianmahd: And I have a way better idea today than I did a year ago, right?
19:18 - Michael Kianmahd: I don't think I think our business was under managed high level
19:24 - Michael Kianmahd: So one of the things that you know aside from the cultural shift
is really trying to push towards being data-oriented and metrics driven and
19:32 - Michael Kianmahd: Focused but as you know it's hard to do so with the current
confines of our system.
19:37 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah So while this is fantastic Like let's say we had metrics for
the intake team.
19:47 - Michael Kianmahd: I don't know that we have the ability today to identify some of the
things that would be relevant to properly judge or assess the intake team's effectiveness.
19:57 - Adrian Boerstra: Right.
19:58 - Michael Kianmahd: Same with credit.
20:02 - Michael Kianmahd: We've got a lot that we do, like I do kind of mini versions of this
with like very critical data and data that's available to us across the business.
20:13 - Michael Kianmahd: Probably the most impactful is like related to our monthly
reporting to our bank.
20:17 - Michael Kianmahd: We have a barring-based facility, it's very complicated, there's a
lot of metrics they track.
20:21 - Michael Kianmahd: We have financial covenants we have to meet.
20:25 - Michael Kianmahd: There's a layer of accounting that impacts that.
20:29 - Michael Kianmahd: So none of this is new or difficult.
20:33 - Michael Kianmahd: I think what's lacking today is having that level of detail on
operational aspects of the business that are non-financial.
20:42 - Michael Kianmahd: That's what's kind of missing.
20:44 - Adrian Boerstra: Absolutely, and that's pretty much typical for anybody.
20:48 - Adrian Boerstra: And the idea of starting with like this style of meeting is that you
start to have just this repeatable kind of format and way of being able to address those
things.
20:59 - Adrian Boerstra: So like, to be honest, your very first rocks might be around identifying
what are our metrics that we're gonna have in the scorecard, what's the most important thing
based on the value stream or the business?
21:17 - Adrian Boerstra: What are the to-dos that we're gonna have?
21:19 - Adrian Boerstra: Well, somebody's gonna meet with Laura to make sure that we can
get the right report out of Salesforce or capture the right data in Salesforce to do the timing.
21:29 - Adrian Boerstra: And we actually already have some of that stuff, those milestones
in our plan today.
21:36 - Adrian Boerstra: But I was thinking that in terms of implementing sort of a discipline
which could be used as a format.
21:45 - Adrian Boerstra: Laura has mentioned to me that there's already a steering commit-
tee meeting that she's a part of that happens once a week.
21:52 - Adrian Boerstra: We can look at implementing a structure like this, you know, within
the scope of that meeting and how that's run and start to drive.
22:03 - Adrian Boerstra: If people are having rocks that they're responsible for, then that
becomes a vehicle by which we can start to drive those other milestones so that it's not all
relying on you to be the driver on everything.
22:21 - Adrian Boerstra: That's the thought.
22:23 - Adrian Boerstra: And then that way when we go, let's flip from this back to the
portfolio view there, Laura.
22:35 - Adrian Boerstra: So then when you're looking at this level, what you're seeing is we've
got all of our or value streams down the left-hand side.
22:42 - Adrian Boerstra: And then these milestones would essentially, you know, map directly
to the rocks that you've highlighted out of your meetings.
22:50 - Adrian Boerstra: And then once a quarter, you're going through a plan.
22:53 - Adrian Boerstra: There's like an extended meeting that you do with the team where
we're planning out our rocks for the upcoming quarter.
22:59 - Adrian Boerstra: And then we then build out our roadmap to kind of coincide with
that or validate the road.
23:06 - Adrian Boerstra: Cause we may have, there's a good chance will have already from
a build or technical perspective have kind of built ahead.
23:12 - Adrian Boerstra: But as people identify new rocks for the upcoming quarter, we may
match that against what we're building within Salesforce technically and say, hey, is this, are
we still aligned with the right processes or the right priorities?
23:26 - Adrian Boerstra: Or should we adjust based on the things that are most important
to the business right now by each value stream?
23:37 - Adrian Boerstra: Bye.
23:45 - Michael Kianmahd: So we have a version of that.
23:51 - Michael Kianmahd: I think the challenge is like there's the maximum kind of company
level initiatives or backbone of the business.
24:00 - Michael Kianmahd: and then attached to that is technology and Then on the other
side attached to that is in analytics Mm-hmm.
24:10 - Michael Kianmahd: I think they're kind of like an analytics partner helping us build
scorecards and kind of touching other aspects of the business
24:17 - Michael Kianmahd: Mm-hmm, and it you know, they basically came to La we spent
a bunch of time
24:23 - Michael Kianmahd: with us and
24:25 - Michael Kianmahd: they basically captured a bunch of projects
24:28 - Michael Kianmahd: that we want to engage in
24:33 - Michael Kianmahd: basically from what they heard.
24:35 - Michael Kianmahd: Okay.
24:35 - Michael Kianmahd: And there's like complexity level, impact level, value created, and
sort of category or timeline.
24:44 - Adrian Boerstra: And this is focused on analytics?
24:46 - Michael Kianmahd: No.
24:47 - Michael Kianmahd: Or just in general?
24:49 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah, I think they're kind of like trying to be more than just an
analytics company.
24:55 - Michael Kianmahd: I think they're also trying to be like consultants.
24:58 - Adrian Boerstra: Sure.
24:59 - Michael Kianmahd: They
25:02 - Michael Kianmahd: built a roadmap.
25:06 - Michael Kianmahd: The roadmap has functional pieces of the business, and projects
that relate to those functional pieces.
25:17 - Michael Kianmahd: Submission and underwriting, collections and asset manage-
ment, reporting and dashboards and business management.
25:23 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah.
25:23 - Michael Kianmahd: So maybe this is more Bi and this is just more like operational
support.
25:30 - Michael Kianmahd: You know?
25:31 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah, yeah.
25:34 - Adrian Boerstra: So yeah, in an underwriting and collections and asset management
sort of mapped to like what we're referring to as the value streams.
25:44 - Adrian Boerstra: It's just a little bit more.
25:47 - Michael Kianmahd: It's a little bit more what?
25:48 - Adrian Boerstra: A little bit more broad.
25:50 - Adrian Boerstra: We've got it divided up into, I think, deeper areas.
25:55 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah.
25:56 - Michael Kianmahd: So these are kind of like this is the year, basically.
26:01 - Michael Kianmahd: Can you see?
26:01 - Michael Kianmahd: Is it large enough?
26:03 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah.
26:03 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah, I can see.
26:05 - Michael Kianmahd: So this is kind of what, I mean, this hasn't been updated since
like later last year, earlier this year.
26:12 - Michael Kianmahd: So the timing might be like a couple of months off, given how
large it is.
26:16 - Adrian Boerstra: There's a lot of alignment between what we're showing on ours and
what.
26:20 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah.
26:22 - Michael Kianmahd: So.
26:25 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah, there is.
26:28 - Michael Kianmahd: Basically.
26:31 - Michael Kianmahd: This was like the workshop stuff.
26:32 - Michael Kianmahd: So like all the things that Laura is like in the thick of she's touching
probably 70 ish percent of that.
26:40 - Michael Kianmahd: And a lot of it's Salesforce process driven.
26:42 - Michael Kianmahd: Like how do we do business?
26:44 - Adrian Boerstra: Mm-hmm.
26:46 - Michael Kianmahd: You know how we currently do business to how we should
do business So it could be like as frictionless as possible considering the constraints and
setting us up for a brighter future Yeah, and 30% is like more developmental work like how
can we push?
27:00 - Michael Kianmahd: the decision-making engine How can we drive collections?
27:05 - Michael Kianmahd: productivity Mm-hmm better track efficacy of our different
initiatives Yeah, we make sure the models performing as expected or better than expected.
27:18 - Michael Kianmahd: Prepare to shut the system down if it's showing some deviation
so we don't continue grouping a problem like those.
27:27 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah, so that's a 30% that I don't think you guys see or touch.
27:31 - Michael Kianmahd: You might get involved if there's like an Api connection, but the
bigger picture kind of more impactful aspect of it is not is not visible to you.
27:39 - Michael Kianmahd: to you.
27:40 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah.
27:41 - Michael Kianmahd: Which is okay because that's not the role you play, you know?
27:45 - Adrian Boerstra: Yes and no.
27:47 - Adrian Boerstra: I think definitely being informed by the bigger picture is really helpful.
27:52 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah.
27:52 - Adrian Boerstra: I want to make sure that when we're doing a roadmap, our roadmap
like looking at this and knowing that there's a separate road, everything should marry up
really nicely and play well together so that everything is co-timed together.
28:08 - Adrian Boerstra: So I think it's definitely important for us to have that level of visibility
to understand how it all plays in because then we can support your existing strategy.
28:19 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah, so a couple, just the way I'm thinking about this and I
didn't hear in the presentation, which maybe it's something we're talking about with Dave
tomorrow, is that right?
28:30 - Adrian Boerstra: Possibly, tell me what you're thinking and I'll tell you whether we're
talking about it.
28:39 - Michael Kianmahd: So, so high level like I view today, Ken and Faye as basically
extensions of our team.
30:21 - Michael Kianmahd: The point at which the sort of fractional, let's call it Cto, Cio,
Salesforce developer model starts becoming more expensive than just looking for a full-time
hire.
30:36 - Michael Kianmahd: And then having a full-time hire basically manage resources in
the offshore.
30:41 - Michael Kianmahd: So that's kind of like the next step for us, if we can't figure it out
this way.
30:45 - Michael Kianmahd: conversation that Dave laid out was like maybe you need like a
30:48 - Michael Kianmahd: Like I
30:52 - Michael Kianmahd: Forgot what he called it, but Laura you also made a reference to
where it's like you have like a part like a part-time
30:57 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah, yeah, or even something someone full-time
31:01 - Michael Kianmahd: They're a Faye employee
31:02 - Michael Kianmahd: But you know they're pretty much working our stuff full-time
because how much we're trying to get done is because we're trying to get it
31:07 - Michael Kianmahd: Done, which I'm open to if it's priced
31:10 - Michael Kianmahd: Within budget in some capacity right so like maybe there's like
full margin added
31:15 - Michael Kianmahd: Like when you're a fractional user and you're using 10% of Laura's
time it comes at a much greater period
31:20 - Michael Kianmahd: Premium, but if you're using a hundred percent of our time,
maybe there's like a little bit of a
31:25 - Michael Kianmahd: Discount you get you know it's still very profitable for Faye
31:29 - Michael Kianmahd: But maybe it's like a little bit more affordable for us so like we
don't get where we want to go faster
31:34 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah, absolutely, and we so now I can answer.
31:38 - Adrian Boerstra: Yes.
31:38 - Adrian Boerstra: We'll get into some of that stuff more tomorrow though I want to
make like I don't want to push anything that we don't already feel is the answer.
31:48 - Adrian Boerstra: Like, I want to identify for sure what it is we need before suggesting
that, you know.
31:53 - Adrian Boerstra: Because I'm not looking to sell people or hours to you.
31:57 - Adrian Boerstra: I'm just looking to solve challenges and then that will be a byproduct
of it.
32:00 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah, so what you just said is, has been the hardest thing to
judge, right?
32:05 - Michael Kianmahd: For me.
32:05 - Michael Kianmahd: So, like.
32:08 - Michael Kianmahd: I think we're doing a much better job than, say, a year ago
identifying.
32:13 - Michael Kianmahd: all the things that need to get done and then trying to prioritize
them.
32:18 - Michael Kianmahd: What's missing is like, okay, here are the priorities, they align with
the business, here's what they're gonna cost, here's the timeline, you can shrink the timeline
if you ratchet this up.
32:32 - Michael Kianmahd: And then I can make that decision easily.
32:34 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah, now it's like there's a lot of information.
32:38 - Adrian Boerstra: It's so that and that kind of brings me back to why I'm suggesting
this Eos approach because the Eos runs on a quarterly cycle around those rocks.
32:49 - Adrian Boerstra: So you set your rocks out.
32:51 - Adrian Boerstra: And when you finish those three rocks that value stream has for that
quarter, you know, whether it's in the first month or in the third month.
32:59 - Adrian Boerstra: It's like, hey, yeah, we did it.
33:01 - Adrian Boerstra: We hit the most important things we need to get done.
33:03 - Adrian Boerstra: We got those done.
33:04 - Adrian Boerstra: And what I feel is I feel like we get the view when we talk to you, but
I'm not sure if it's like all as well-defined.
33:15 - Adrian Boerstra: And what I wanna do is when we are accomplishing things, it should
be something where it's a team effort.
33:25 - Adrian Boerstra: We're working with your team or whoever is responsible for that
value stream.
33:29 - Adrian Boerstra: And I'd really like to look at it as business outcomes as opposed to
just a technical completion of something.
33:36 - Adrian Boerstra: Now, granted, not every rock is going to require us to do something
technical and that's fine.
33:42 - Adrian Boerstra: Like I'm not trying to get in on that, but everything that we do should
be to support a metric or a goal that the business has.
33:53 - Adrian Boerstra: Otherwise, why are we doing it?
33:55 - Adrian Boerstra: And I think that has been the case.
33:57 - Adrian Boerstra: I just don't think that we've tracked it that way.
33:59 - Adrian Boerstra: I don't, like when we go back and look at everything we've done, you
know, there's no spreadsheet that any of us can look at to, oh, we did this because of this,
and this was the metric or the outcome we were looking for, and did we achieve that?
34:12 - Adrian Boerstra: And so what I'm just trying to do is think about, well, how can
we establish metrics that are important to the business so that we're always supporting
something that is measured?
34:26 - Adrian Boerstra: And then we're not just like, You know, it does no good to actually
measure hours or whatever, what you wanna do is look at the whole thing and go on a
quarterly basis, this is what I'm investing.
34:36 - Adrian Boerstra: What are the rocks that we hit this quarter?
34:38 - Adrian Boerstra: Are we still missing everything the way we would otherwise?
34:41 - Adrian Boerstra: Or are we hitting rocks that are really moving our business forward?
34:44 - Adrian Boerstra: And I think in my experience from managing my business, using
that meeting format with the steering committee, with people accountable for metrics, is
the, that's the tip of the spear for enabling everything else.
35:00 - Adrian Boerstra: And that's where I'm kind of going, okay, we've got, I actually feel
like a roadmap is pretty good when I look at those milestones, the stuff that you've worked
out with Laura.
35:11 - Adrian Boerstra: I think a lot of it is probably pretty good, and I don't know how much
of it would have to change.
35:15 - Adrian Boerstra: They all look like things that would be important to the business and
I'd want to do if I were you.
35:19 - Adrian Boerstra: But I really don't know that when we get to the end of it, we'll know
what metrics we moved as a result of it.
35:28 - Adrian Boerstra: And that's the picture I'd like to have in six months.
35:32 - Adrian Boerstra: And I think you would like to have in six months.
35:38 - Michael Kianmahd: Sooner would be great.
35:39 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah, I mean, after the fact, to be able to look back and go, yeah,
look at this, look at what we did, and look how we moved the business forward, and hear
where the actual business outcomes.
35:50 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah, I mean, the way you're framing it is like, it's how I think
about it, and I think, like, you know, to diagnose the issue, like why it hasn't been that way
yet, is, again, faith has been pulled in to solve technical issues.
36:04 - Adrian Boerstra: Mm-hmm.
36:07 - Michael Kianmahd: So, you know, if your suggestion is like, let's zoom out, let's adopt
a new format of running business initiatives
36:17 - Michael Kianmahd: kind of Eos strategy, meeting strategy, let's align more closely
with the Maxim core team and Kin and sort of get on the same page of how to do this going
forward, Mm-hmm a great.
36:33 - Michael Kianmahd: Let's do that Asap I mean look like you know we pulled Laura into
the workshop meeting so she can keep track of those things a lot of those things are also
aligned with Eos formatting What's probably lacking are?
36:49 - Michael Kianmahd: you know certain types of metrics other than deadlines, but
Changing those things will enhance business process which will then improve metrics
improve outcomes Yeah, everything we're doing is outcomes based but like Can I can you
tell me what the outcome or sorry?
37:07 - Michael Kianmahd: What what metrics we should use to?
37:10 - Michael Kianmahd: Fix our data model
37:13 - Michael Kianmahd: You know, it's like a means to an end, you know, it's like you got
to fix a data model
37:16 - Adrian Boerstra: It is and that's important
37:18 - Adrian Boerstra: so the data model like the metrics wouldn't aren't going to change
every quarter the metrics are going to be something that like
37:27 - Adrian Boerstra: So when we go through the exercise of helping a team
37:29 - Adrian Boerstra: to figure out what their metrics should be
37:31 - Adrian Boerstra: one of the things we start off with is like
37:33 - Adrian Boerstra: okay, you're on a deserted island and let's look at it.
37:38 - Adrian Boerstra: I mean, first of all, we could look at it from a Ceo perspective.
37:41 - Adrian Boerstra: You're on a desert island.
37:43 - Adrian Boerstra: If you want to know that things are going on, that things are healthy
back home, what would be the five or six things you'd want to hear about every week in order
to assess the health of the company and whether things are operating well.
37:59 - Adrian Boerstra: And then you can break that down, that same question down on a
value stream by value stream basis.
38:03 - Adrian Boerstra: If you went to the leader of application intake and said, you're on an
island, what are the two things that would be most important?
38:11 - Adrian Boerstra: You know, if you could get these answers to these two questions in
a numerical quantitative format, what would be those measures?
38:18 - Adrian Boerstra: And you can have them brainstorm.
38:20 - Adrian Boerstra: So when I did this with my team, you know, everybody came up with
like six, seven different metrics, but you can't go through a team of, you know, a steering
committee of seven people that have seven metrics each.
38:32 - Adrian Boerstra: You got 50 metrics, not like you have 49 metrics and none of them
mean anything now.
38:39 - Adrian Boerstra: So, you know, then you go through this whittling down of, okay, are
these the most important things?
38:44 - Adrian Boerstra: And the nice thing about doing it that way is you gotta think first,
not about what can we measure, but what should we measure?
38:52 - Adrian Boerstra: Like, what do I need to know?
38:55 - Michael Kianmahd: Because- We went through that in our last call, no?
38:57 - Michael Kianmahd: What was that?
38:58 - Adrian Boerstra: We went through that in our last call.
38:59 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah, I threw out some examples and then kind of threw out a few
other ones.
39:04 - Adrian Boerstra: So I would start with like that sort of as a list.
39:08 - Michael Kianmahd: But I think- Yeah, I've got it.
39:11 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah, do you want me to pop it open?
39:13 - Michael Kianmahd: Sure.
39:19 - Michael Kianmahd: You know, one metric per function, is that right?
39:24 - Michael Kianmahd: That's what you want?
39:25 - Adrian Boerstra: Overall, as a steering committee, you probably don't want more than,
you know, seven to ten.
39:33 - Adrian Boerstra: So it doesn't have to, it should be at least one per function.
39:36 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah.
39:42 - Laura: Are we going to be probably another I was I scheduled and Charles for now.
39:49 - Laura: Are we going to be the next 20?
39:51 - Laura: Should I just reschedule?
39:54 - Michael Kianmahd: It's up to you guys.
39:56 - Adrian Boerstra: I'm supposed to be joining on to another meeting.
39:58 - Adrian Boerstra: Now that I'm late for as well, but I've got this open in front of me.
40:03 - Michael Kianmahd: Let me just.
40:03 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah, do you guys want to have a deeper I mean, conceptually,
I'm bought in, like, I understand, I think it makes sense.
40:10 - Adrian Boerstra: Right now, like, those metrics, that it's actually, if you're a follow Eos
and I found it helpful is we've kind of brainstormed and we may have an idea of what we
want those metrics to be.
40:26 - Adrian Boerstra: But there is a bit of a process of going through and discussing this
with the leader so that they take ownership of those metrics.
40:33 - Adrian Boerstra: As well.
40:34 - Adrian Boerstra: So I probably wouldn't just push those metrics on them.
40:38 - Adrian Boerstra: I'd go through a process with them, which if you want help to
facilitate that conversation, I'm happy to do that.
40:46 - Adrian Boerstra: Or I can kind of point you in, you know, into some resources that
you can use to, to guide you on how to do that really well.
40:55 - Adrian Boerstra: But I found it really helpful to go through with the team and have
them kind of come up with that list of five or six different things and then whittle it down so
that they feel really confident about those two measures.
41:06 - Adrian Boerstra: And then you start to work forward with it from there.
41:09 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah.
41:12 - Michael Kianmahd: Quick question.
41:23 - Michael Kianmahd: What's sort of like triggering this suggestion for you?
41:28 - Michael Kianmahd: Is it sort of a reaction to what I've been asking for?
41:30 - Michael Kianmahd: Is it?
41:32 - Adrian Boerstra: It is because, so I go back to what I know, right?
41:37 - Adrian Boerstra: And for me, within my organization, everything was based on what
I'm talking about here as a discipline.
41:45 - Adrian Boerstra: And what I've seen for you is that
41:51 - Adrian Boerstra: so much keeps coming back to you
41:53 - Adrian Boerstra: and you having to own it and feeling
41:55 - Adrian Boerstra: and other people in the organization
41:58 - Adrian Boerstra: sort of responding as though, hey, I don't have time
42:02 - Adrian Boerstra: whether it was the testing, whether it like
42:05 - Adrian Boerstra: they feel like it's taking them out
42:06 - Adrian Boerstra: of what they have to do every day
42:08 - Adrian Boerstra: as opposed to seeing that what they have to do every day
42:11 - Adrian Boerstra: is driving value within their own area.
42:17 - Adrian Boerstra: And so what you wanna do is transfer that leadership to those
people so that they're going, hey, I'm responsible for a metric.
42:25 - Adrian Boerstra: And I have a plan for, you know, these are my rocks for the quarter.
42:29 - Adrian Boerstra: Because as soon as you have, if you have that, to me, that's the
foundation.
42:33 - Adrian Boerstra: Technology is there completely to empower the business.
42:37 - Adrian Boerstra: It shouldn't be driving what the business decisions are.
42:40 - Adrian Boerstra: It should be taking those business decisions and empowering them
and supporting them.
42:46 - Adrian Boerstra: And so the dynamic that I see is where it feels to me like we're
coming up with ideas with you.
42:53 - Adrian Boerstra: Then we're working to kind of implement them.
42:55 - Adrian Boerstra: And then we're trying to figure out how that drives value.
42:57 - Adrian Boerstra: and we're trying to sell your constituents on that this is valuable,
what we're doing.
43:03 - Adrian Boerstra: And to me, it's a little bit backwards.
43:06 - Michael Kianmahd: You know why there is, so I think there's just general fatigue.
43:11 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah.
43:12 - Michael Kianmahd: Because things have been slow to launch and slow to get
delivered.
43:17 - Michael Kianmahd: And I think level of engagement goes up
43:22 - Michael Kianmahd: goes up when, generally speaking
43:25 - Michael Kianmahd: in a big group of people where there are multiple owners
43:28 - Michael Kianmahd: of a bunch of things and people have competing priorities
43:31 - Michael Kianmahd: if people don't see the light at the end of the tunnel
43:34 - Michael Kianmahd: they're like, why should I be on this call?
43:38 - Michael Kianmahd: Let me just go do my day job.
43:43 - Michael Kianmahd: They don't really understand when it's gonna be completed.
43:48 - Michael Kianmahd: So having a high-level macro Eos program is just gonna feel like
another buzzwordy, ineffective way of not actually getting things delivered.
44:00 - Michael Kianmahd: It's like, it will feel to them as a distraction.
44:03 - Michael Kianmahd: It doesn't feel like that to me, but it will feel like to them as like,
what is this?
44:08 - Adrian Boerstra: I don't understand it.
44:09 - Adrian Boerstra: Mike, so here's, we don't even have to use Eos.
44:12 - Adrian Boerstra: I use it with you so that you know what I'm referring to.
44:15 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah.
44:15 - Adrian Boerstra: We don't have to pitch this as Eos at all.
44:19 - Adrian Boerstra: We can pitch this as, so that, I think the big thing
44:25 - Adrian Boerstra: that's of value to them is we will work feverishly
44:28 - Adrian Boerstra: to help you accomplish, if you identify quarter over quarter
44:33 - Adrian Boerstra: for your value stream, what the most important things
44:35 - Adrian Boerstra: are to get done, we will work feverishly
44:38 - Adrian Boerstra: to make sure you have that.
44:39 - Adrian Boerstra: And now we, in our conversations, can say, hey, do we have all the
right resources we need?
44:45 - Adrian Boerstra: This quarter we have four different rocks that are gonna depend on
some big things changing in Salesforce.
44:52 - Adrian Boerstra: Do we have enough resources to get that done?
44:54 - Adrian Boerstra: All right, let's plan around that.
44:55 - Adrian Boerstra: But now you can plan around a business initiative that is really
important and owned by people within the business.
45:03 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah, so I'm just trying to think about
45:08 - Michael Kianmahd: I'm thinking like already how to execute this so that it actually
has an impact, okay?
45:12 - Michael Kianmahd: So what we're doing already today, So like already on my
calendar.
45:19 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah, let me just show you guys a bunch of stuff just so you have
text and then.
45:25 - Laura: I'm going to reschedule that.
45:30 - Adrian Boerstra: I mean, if you want Laura, you can, I'm an optional on my other
meeting.
45:35 - Adrian Boerstra: If you want to drop off or make.
45:37 - Adrian Boerstra: you can go ahead and I'll continue with Michael on this.
45:42 - Laura: I'm good either way.
45:42 - Laura: You guys let me know if you want me here.
45:44 - Michael Kianmahd: If you do, I'll just reschedule.
45:46 - Michael Kianmahd: It's just- Yeah, why don't you stay on so you have this information
too, Laura, because like- That's fine, I'll just let them know.
45:51 - Laura: I'll do it a clear bunch thing.
45:53 - Adrian Boerstra: Okay.
45:54 - Adrian Boerstra: I'm gonna munch on a sandwich here while we're going.
45:57 - Laura: That's completely fine.
45:58 - Laura: Loud.
46:00 - Michael Kianmahd: All right.
46:03 - Michael Kianmahd: So basically, top down is the way I think about it.
46:13 - Michael Kianmahd: So basically the reality is I'm working 60-80 hours a week.
46:19 - Michael Kianmahd: I'm tracking all the stuff that I do.
46:22 - Michael Kianmahd: This is all the stuff that I do.
46:24 - Adrian Boerstra: Okay?
46:25 - Michael Kianmahd: Mm-hmm.
46:26 - Michael Kianmahd: It's insane.
46:29 - Michael Kianmahd: And I have my goals written down, right?
46:32 - Michael Kianmahd: So I have a list of goals of what we're doing and what we're trying
to achieve and all that kind of stuff, personal and professional.
46:39 - Michael Kianmahd: And one of the things that I realized that has helped scale my
time are monthly check-ins with departments or teams that cover important aspects of the
business, including the meeting that we have with Ken and this meeting and the steering
committee meeting.
47:04 - Laura: Yep.
47:07 - Michael Kianmahd: So, I would say the biggest difference between what you're
proposing Adrian, and what already is being done is right now, it's like sort of fragmented.
47:20 - Michael Kianmahd: For example, every two weeks I have an asset management
meeting.
47:29 - Michael Kianmahd: These people are involved.
47:31 - Michael Kianmahd: Asset management is from the point of repossession to the sale
of the asset.
47:37 - Michael Kianmahd: And there's a really unique feedback loop that could be provided
between collections, asset management and credit.
47:47 - Michael Kianmahd: And it's more of a tactical meeting.
47:51 - Michael Kianmahd: We sit down, we look at reviews, we look at reporting, we get kind
of what's going on a sort of every other week basis.
47:59 - Michael Kianmahd: And then every time we have a conversation, we come up with
a list of action items.
48:04 - Michael Kianmahd: And then those action items are tracked week over week to make
sure that things are getting done appropriately.
48:09 - Michael Kianmahd: And sometimes action items kind of stay on and we just kind of
like keep letting them bubble up, but for the most part, we're just knocking out what we can.
48:17 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah, so you're doing some task management there.
48:22 - Adrian Boerstra: I think the value of the Eos approach is that in every meeting, before
we get into our to-dos and solving problems, we're revisiting the data.
48:37 - Adrian Boerstra: So your true north is always set based on two things, the data, the
performance data and the metrics.
48:44 - Adrian Boerstra: So, that, what that does right off the bat at the beginning of the
meeting is says, hey, are we doing well or is there something we have to improve on here?
48:52 - Adrian Boerstra: And then that, and that starts to set the focus for the meeting as
opposed to just whatever whim somebody has.
48:58 - Adrian Boerstra: The other thing that you might find is sometimes on meetings,
something was a task a couple
49:03 - Adrian Boerstra: weeks ago and it doesn't even seem that relevant anymore or
doesn't seem that important, but
49:07 - Adrian Boerstra: it's important because it's there and you start to go, well, wait a
minute, why was
49:11 - Adrian Boerstra: this important again?
49:13 - Adrian Boerstra: Having that like, here's what our rocks are, are we on track, off track,
here's what our measures are, how are we doing on our weekly measures, that sets like the,
everything else starts to get prioritized based on the things that are truly important.
49:27 - Adrian Boerstra: And so that sets a bit of a compass for the rest of the meeting.
49:32 - Michael Kianmahd: I'm with you.
49:33 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah.
49:34 - Adrian Boerstra: So it sounds like you have, like, you might just need, and I wasn't
actually necessarily suggest coming here to suggest that, hey, start implementing Eos
throughout the whole company.
49:45 - Adrian Boerstra: Although, although you could, and I would probably, I would certainly
support that concept.
49:51 - Adrian Boerstra: I was just, you know, as I was getting into it with Laura, and how do
we kind of solve for this?
49:56 - Adrian Boerstra: I thought, well, if just even as a steering committee around what are
we doing with Salesforce, and what's our roadmap there?
50:04 - Adrian Boerstra: I'd really want that to be the result of a business conversation and
I kind of thought, well, Eos probably gives us a good meeting format to establish that.
50:12 - Adrian Boerstra: But certainly, you know, what I would, here's, if I was to wear my Eos
implementer hat, what I would be saying to you is you should have one executive meeting
with everybody on your leadership team once a week for 90 minutes and follow a format like
this.
50:30 - Adrian Boerstra: Then let them have their subcommittee meetings that you may or
may not attend and have somebody in charge of each of those.
50:38 - Adrian Boerstra: They can then, you know, roll down from the executive meeting
whatever the metrics are that they want to measure and then roll that up to your executive
leadership team meeting once a week.
50:50 - Adrian Boerstra: So Eos should result in everybody actually having fewer meetings,
not more.
50:57 - Adrian Boerstra: That's what, you know, an Eos implementer practitioner would say
is everybody should have one meeting with the team that reports to them and one meeting
with the person they report once a week.
51:14 - Adrian Boerstra: So that's sort of more of a purist approach to it.
51:18 - Adrian Boerstra: But then every meeting should be based on data, should be based
on rocks and goals that we're trying to achieve that are...
51:24 - Adrian Boerstra: And the thing about having that level of focus.
51:27 - Adrian Boerstra: Like one of the things I notice is you've got your analysis, you know,
we've got our milestones that we've got set out and Asana for you, then you've got your
planning that you've done with the analytics company and they've got a roadmap.
51:39 - Adrian Boerstra: Now we've got multiple roadmaps and then the team starts to go,
what is this the program of the month?
51:45 - Adrian Boerstra: Whatever you decide on within this, the steering committee and
whatever you put down as your rocks, those are the most important things for that depart-
ment to get done, nothing else.
51:55 - Adrian Boerstra: I mean they're going to get other things done in the course of doing
business.
51:58 - Adrian Boerstra: But they feel if they get those two or three rocks that they had set out
for the quarter done and accomplished, then they know that they're moving things forward
as a department.
52:09 - Adrian Boerstra: And when other things come up during that quarter that might be,
you know, shiny objects, we go, hey, let's put that as potentially a rock for the next quarter,
because that is, is that going to be more important?
52:20 - Adrian Boerstra: Or do we have to shift and now make that a priority over something
we already identified as a Roc.
52:26 - Adrian Boerstra: I can, you know, when Covid hit, we had to make some adjustments
to our Rocs almost immediately after we just finished leadership planning.
52:33 - Adrian Boerstra: But for the most part, it's really important to start to be consistent
quarter over quarter that when you do your planning, decide what those Rocs are.
52:41 - Adrian Boerstra: Keep to them, stick to them, so that your team can really get that
feel like they're moving forward.
52:46 - Adrian Boerstra: And at that point, don't let the program of the month come in and
then shift everything for them.
52:52 - Adrian Boerstra: And if you do that, they'll feel more focused and they'll always feel
like whatever ideas they have, we're gonna work it out so that there's a way we can get it
done within that quarter and make it a rock.
53:04 - Adrian Boerstra: So it should create more recency, more immediacy, faster turn-
around time, faster releases, and more focus for the team if you kind of go holistic with it.
53:17 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah, give me one second.
53:19 - Michael Kianmahd: Sure.
53:20 - Michael Kianmahd: Okay
53:28 - Michael Kianmahd: so here's a strategic decision.
53:33 - Adrian Boerstra: Okay.
53:34 - Michael Kianmahd: So Laura, is this the version of the org chart you have?
53:38 - Laura: Yep.
53:39 - Laura: Oh, May 13th, hang on, let me just check.
53:45 - Laura: No, mine's April 3rd.
53:47 - Michael Kianmahd: Um, I mean, it's not materially different.
53:52 - Laura: Yeah.
53:52 - Laura: It looks pretty much the same.
53:54 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah.
53:54 - Michael Kianmahd: So I think, um
53:59 - Michael Kianmahd: the biggest challenge, like the reason why I am concerned, the
only reason why I'm concerned about your proposal is because we're missing these people.
54:12 - Adrian Boerstra: Okay.
54:14 - Michael Kianmahd: And the reality is, I don't quite know if there is enough horsepower
here to be able to manage your manage that concept.
54:34 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah, like, yeah.
54:36 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah.
54:36 - Michael Kianmahd: I mean, and really what I'm trying to do
54:38 - Michael Kianmahd: Laura would probably have some insight on this because she
deals with a lot of types of clients and she deals very directly with her
54:44 - Michael Kianmahd: people so she might have very
54:47 - Michael Kianmahd: Cogent and clear
54:51 - Michael Kianmahd: Kind of comparisons, but one of the things that I have realized
is
54:56 - Michael Kianmahd: That I need to
54:57 - Michael Kianmahd: Build out the bench of leadership here.
55:02 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah in these functional areas so the bet that I'm trying to make
55:10 - Michael Kianmahd: is and Obviously kin analytics should be on here.
55:14 - Michael Kianmahd: I have to add them but between info networks Bay Kin analytics
At some point in the future there is like a Cto level person that manages those resources and
make sure that those resources are sort of delivering on business objectives and projects.
55:43 - Michael Kianmahd: Because right now I'm managing those things personally.
55:46 - Michael Kianmahd: Like when a computer gets set up for a new employee, I try to
defer as much as possible to Maria, but they still come to me with questions.
55:54 - Michael Kianmahd: So that's the level of chaos that I unfortunately live in today.
56:00 - Adrian Boerstra: I can so I'll give you I'll give you how again any Os implementer
would approach this.
56:06 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah
56:09 - Adrian Boerstra: So first of all, you're
56:11 - Adrian Boerstra: You've done well here because what you have here isn't really an
org chart
56:15 - Adrian Boerstra: It's an accountability chart because you've got the positions already
in there that
56:20 - Adrian Boerstra: exist
56:22 - Adrian Boerstra: They just aren't filled and so in the Os you definitely look at
56:26 - Adrian Boerstra: what are the responsibilities and roles functionally
56:31 - Adrian Boerstra: before you start looking at people?
56:33 - Adrian Boerstra: Because you don't wanna just create positions for people, you need
to create positions for what's functionally needed in the company.
56:38 - Adrian Boerstra: And you've done that.
56:40 - Adrian Boerstra: And what that means is that you, and you've already identified that
you've got some roles in the company that just aren't being felt today.
56:49 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah, I don't know if you have them already written down what the
job descriptions are for those.
56:54 - Michael Kianmahd: do for pretty much most of them.
56:57 - Michael Kianmahd: And sort of like the biggest key missing piece that I have today,
like is probably this person.
57:48 - Adrian Boerstra: So, what are the next steps?
57:58 - Michael Kianmahd: one and like was when we shifted the organizational structure
of the business to align the Ltr.
58:04 - Michael Kianmahd: And that's basically, I think we talked about that.
58:08 - Michael Kianmahd: That's basically right now this.
58:11 - Michael Kianmahd: Okay.
58:12 - Michael Kianmahd: On our roadmap for the year is also to integrate this.
58:17 - Michael Kianmahd: So we can't do that until the data model is correct and working
and processes are aligned in the same.
58:24 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah.
58:25 - Michael Kianmahd: And that's what that Laura's in the thick of.
58:27 - Michael Kianmahd: On top of that, going through this process, I realized that this is
probably our next hire.
58:33 - Adrian Boerstra: I would agree.
58:35 - Michael Kianmahd: And yeah, you may have seen it, but I've been marketing that
we're hiring this person and I've been proactively reaching out to this people that I think could
do the role.
58:45 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah.
58:46 - Michael Kianmahd: And I spoke to somebody yesterday who worked at a
58:53 - Michael Kianmahd: smaller lender.
58:53 - Michael Kianmahd: lender, they were doing like a hundred million dollars of origina-
tion a year, they got bought by a public company and that public company bought a billion
dollar a year origination company that they bought for a song during Covid.
59:08 - Michael Kianmahd: And he was essentially the chief operating officer and integrator
of all the acquisitions for all the companies they acquired and his like one of his projects was
integrating all the systems together.
59:21 - Adrian Boerstra: So one of the things in In Eos, they refer to that person as their role.
59:29 - Adrian Boerstra: Your role would be a visionary.
59:31 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah.
59:32 - Adrian Boerstra: This person's role, Eos calls this an integrator.
59:35 - Michael Kianmahd: Yep.
59:36 - Adrian Boerstra: So the integrator reports to the visionary and then the integrator
actually has the leadership committee reporting to them.
59:45 - Adrian Boerstra: And they're the person who converts, the concept is as a visionary,
we often, we bring a certain amount of vision, but we also sometimes bring a certain amount
of chaos to the organization because we always have an idea on how to do things better and
everything.
01:00:00 - Adrian Boerstra: And sometimes people get a little bit confused because they're
like, hey, that was the priority last week.
01:00:06 - Adrian Boerstra: This is the priority this week.
01:00:07 - Adrian Boerstra: And they're all great ideas and you can't hold a visionary back.
01:00:12 - Adrian Boerstra: But what an integrator does is sort of organizes all of these great
ideas, starts to line them up and then work with the team to make sure everything becomes
a reality.
01:00:22 - Adrian Boerstra: That's the whole Eos concept behind it.
01:00:24 - Michael Kianmahd: So you're describing your dad more than you've described
me.
01:00:27 - Michael Kianmahd: But what's interesting, I don't know if this is interesting to you,
but if this is boring.
01:00:32 - Michael Kianmahd: No, but like he always seems ahead of his skis and I'm always
like, whoa, slow down, tiger.
01:00:38 - Michael Kianmahd: And then when I took over in the role as Ceo, I was trying to
do the strategic stuff, but I didn't get out of the tactical.
01:00:49 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah, it's funny that you say that because if I was to look at like
personality types from my time working with you
01:00:56 - Adrian Boerstra: um
01:00:58 - Adrian Boerstra: Like
01:01:01 - Adrian Boerstra: I can see that you have the capacity to be visionary in your
thinking and we get into those conversations
01:01:07 - Adrian Boerstra: but I see you constantly being
01:01:11 - Adrian Boerstra: Pulled into the tactical because there's like this vacuum there
and I think that's exactly what you've just shared as well.
01:01:17 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah But it is important functionally to be able to have those
grand ideas and drive the company forward.
01:01:27 - Adrian Boerstra: Otherwise, you're always focused on just being the best at who
you are today and never thinking about where you need to be in a year.
01:01:33 - Adrian Boerstra: So being able to divide up that integrator and visionary is a...
01:01:36 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah.
01:01:38 - Michael Kianmahd: That's pretty much the decision I made.
01:01:40 - Michael Kianmahd: So I'm going to try to find this person.
01:01:48 - Michael Kianmahd: There's meaningful budget allocated there.
01:01:51 - Michael Kianmahd: I decided to hire.
01:01:53 - Michael Kianmahd: Let me share this again.
01:01:55 - Adrian Boerstra: When you're looking at your job description, think about, do a
little bit of Google searching on what an ideal personality profile is for an Eos integrator.
01:02:05 - Adrian Boerstra: And see if your job description already kind of matches up with
that, but it might help to inform, you know, how you look to that.
01:02:17 - Michael Kianmahd: I just sent you the job description.
01:02:20 - Laura: Okay, sorry guys, I've got to drop for another call.
01:02:23 - Laura: Carry on and we're going to talk again tomorrow, so if I miss anything,
Adrian can catch me up.
01:02:28 - Michael Kianmahd: Okay, thanks.
01:02:30 - Michael Kianmahd: So, instead of hiring like these people, Adrian, I want to hire
this person and then have this person coach and mentor these people and then see if we
can level somebody up to here with from within the organization.
01:02:48 - Michael Kianmahd: And if not, we'll go external.
01:02:51 - Michael Kianmahd: I want to make that move for a year to give this time to this
person to make sure that this person gets to know everybody understands the process solve
some of the problems with us gets to know you guys can how the business operates.
01:03:09 - Michael Kianmahd: Strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats, level sets and
sort of a six to 12 month time frame.
01:03:20 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah.
01:03:20 - Michael Kianmahd: And then from that point on, we, we built an organization that
could scale much better than it could scale today.
01:03:27 - Michael Kianmahd: Start pushing on sales at that point, because we've got best
in class models.
01:03:33 - Michael Kianmahd: We've got the best process we can possibly come up with
considering all the investment we've made with you guys.
01:03:39 - Michael Kianmahd: And we're kind of now at a point where we can start growing
the business again in a more aggressive standpoint.
01:03:46 - Michael Kianmahd: Because we've got the credit fail safe
01:03:49 - Michael Kianmahd: we've got operational effectiveness
01:03:51 - Michael Kianmahd: perhaps we've delivered on a couple Apis
01:03:53 - Michael Kianmahd: or starting to talk to a couple of key partners
01:03:56 - Michael Kianmahd: on Api development and we've got all the e-signature
01:03:58 - Michael Kianmahd: stuff working and getting a deal documented
01:04:01 - Michael Kianmahd: and funded is very efficient
01:04:02 - Michael Kianmahd: doesn't have a lot of friction.
01:04:04 - Michael Kianmahd: That's where I want to be in 12 months or less.
01:04:07 - Adrian Boerstra: So, so here's the way here's where I would go from where you're
at today is.
01:04:14 - Adrian Boerstra: You've, you've pretty much called it out right now.
01:04:16 - Adrian Boerstra: You are the functioning.
01:04:18 - Adrian Boerstra: Lead for each of those departments.
01:04:21 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah, which.
01:04:26 - Adrian Boerstra: Is what it is, it means that there's an issue there's an ongoing
issue on your list to solve for that.
01:04:33 - Adrian Boerstra: You're not ready to completely solve for yet.
01:04:37 - Adrian Boerstra: Because any time that you have somebody occupying more than
one role in the organization, that's generally, call it like a right person, right seat sort of issue
that gets solved.
01:04:53 - Adrian Boerstra: But we know that.
01:04:54 - Adrian Boerstra: And in the meantime, like, you're a large enough organization, a
complex enough organization that you can already implement the structure.
01:05:03 - Adrian Boerstra: It just means that you might be the team lead for each of those
areas.
01:05:06 - Adrian Boerstra: If you feel like you don't have anybody underneath there, that
would be the kind of person that could just sort of take those measures and those metrics
and start to focus on it from that perspective.
01:05:24 - Michael Kianmahd: Say that again.
01:05:26 - Adrian Boerstra: So if you really feel like at this point, you're not confident that
anybody in your organization could jump into one of those roles, then you're kind of stuck
with, hey, this is gonna be you heading that up.
01:05:40 - Adrian Boerstra: So you're gonna have to sort of switch hats within the meeting
and think about it from each sort of departmental perspective until you start to get new
people into those proper roles.
01:05:53 - Adrian Boerstra: But functionally, you should be able to continue to operate.
01:05:56 - Adrian Boerstra: You just have to start to prepare the foundation in the structure
so that you can go, Ok, I no longer have to be our Coo.
01:06:07 - Adrian Boerstra: I'm going to plug the Coo in here.
01:06:09 - Adrian Boerstra: I actually, at different points in my organization, I had an inte-
grator reporting to me.
01:06:19 - Adrian Boerstra: But then I occupied roles within this meeting that reported in to
the integrator.
01:06:25 - Adrian Boerstra: So sometimes there were periods of time where I wore a hat,
where I had to, I kind of took direction from somebody who reported to me for periods of
time in order to sort of keep the structure moving.
01:06:41 - Michael Kianmahd: Makes sense.
01:06:42 - Adrian Boerstra: But you know, knowing where everybody sits on the account-
ability chart and what hat they're wearing at any given time starts, it's just a little bit
more challenging when you have, you know, when you have to occupy multiple roles, but
sometimes that's just the way it is.
01:06:57 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah.
01:07:00 - Adrian Boerstra: But yeah, so I mean, there are some Youtube videos.
01:07:05 - Adrian Boerstra: I talked to Laura about having, Laura's actually very good at
moderating and kind of keeping people
01:07:10 - Adrian Boerstra: you know, she doesn't mind, one of the things is that when you're
running one of these meetings
01:07:16 - Adrian Boerstra: there has to be a moderator who might be a little bit abrupt and
can, like
01:07:21 - Adrian Boerstra: if somebody goes off on their vacation and takes up the first 15
minutes all
01:07:26 - Adrian Boerstra: to themselves of the segue.
01:07:29 - Adrian Boerstra: Somebody's got to be there to go, hey, you know, we're glad that
you had a great weekend.
01:07:32 - Adrian Boerstra: Let's go to the next person and sort of gently prod the meeting
along.
01:07:37 - Adrian Boerstra: Or if somebody is reporting on a metric in the scorecard and they
are disappointed and they start talking because they're uncomfortable about how much they
missed the mark by, we have to prod the meeting along and keep it going.
01:07:50 - Adrian Boerstra: We just drop it to the ideas section and keep it moving.
01:07:53 - Adrian Boerstra: So I talked to Laura about, you know, how she felt about running
the meetings, you know, with that and she said she'd be, she'd be good with being that
moderator for you on those meetings.
01:08:09 - Adrian Boerstra: But it sounds like, do you have anybody, would you say at that
level, you're in really all of those roles?
01:08:16 - Adrian Boerstra: Do you have anybody in the organization today that you would
have take on the ownership?
01:08:25 - Adrian Boerstra: I'm not of the meeting, I mean of like any one of those value
stream areas.
01:08:34 - Michael Kianmahd: I mean, I'd have to think about each one of them.
01:08:38 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah, I mean, everyone has skills.
01:08:43 - Michael Kianmahd: and I want to give the chance, but I think, I think where we've
run out of steam is like, there's a disconnect between
01:08:57 - Michael Kianmahd: there's blockers that are technical, and none of us can fix it.
01:09:03 - Michael Kianmahd: Like, if you gave me a math problem, I'd solve it for you.
01:09:05 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah, but these are way more complicated problems, And we
go to fix something, and then we realize there's like 10 other things that need to be fixed.
01:09:16 - Michael Kianmahd: The one thing we set out to fix because of the 10 things that
need to be fixed before you fix that one thing.
01:09:23 - Michael Kianmahd: And that's been the issue, is like, oh, we can't fix Docusign
until we have Lightning.
01:09:29 - Michael Kianmahd: Okay, what do we have to get people on Lightning?
01:09:31 - Michael Kianmahd: Okay, we gotta turn off Dupecatcher.
01:09:34 - Michael Kianmahd: And then we've gotta turn off these validations.
01:09:40 - Adrian Boerstra: But to put someone in one of those roles, they don't have to know
how to solve that problem.
01:09:46 - Adrian Boerstra: They just need to know that it needs to be solved and need to
be a driver, a personality that is able to be a leader and help to drive that.
01:09:53 - Michael Kianmahd: Feels like a Coo to me.
01:09:57 - Michael Kianmahd: I don't think we have that.
01:09:59 - Michael Kianmahd: That's what I'm trying to say.
01:09:59 - Michael Kianmahd: It's like, I don't think we have that person.
01:10:01 - Michael Kianmahd: I think like I filled that role for certain things that are within
my ability to manage.
01:10:08 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah.
01:10:09 - Michael Kianmahd: delegated that to
01:10:13 - Michael Kianmahd: Fay or to Ken for things that are outside of my
01:10:15 - Adrian Boerstra: confidence
01:10:18 - Michael Kianmahd: You know and I still have oversight in my role as Ceo yeah
and
01:10:25 - Michael Kianmahd: You know the nut that's been hard to crack is
01:10:28 - Michael Kianmahd: Like actually delivering on time and on budget and I there's a
lack of budget awareness
01:10:35 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah around what stuff costs or what stuff will cost
01:10:40 - Michael Kianmahd: because of how this relationship has been managed.
01:10:45 - Michael Kianmahd: There's also a lack of insight into how long things are going
to take because of the feedback I get, which is there's a lot of technical debt and it's really
hard to know.
01:10:54 - Michael Kianmahd: You just have to dig into it.
01:10:56 - Adrian Boerstra: Okay.
01:10:57 - Adrian Boerstra: Here's a suggestion.
01:10:59 - Adrian Boerstra: I haven't been on one of those steering committee meetings that
happen once a week, because you've got representation on those meetings, but is that a
meeting with a lot of people who really are like, How does that meeting go and how does
that?
01:11:14 - Adrian Boerstra: Are they is it?
01:11:16 - Adrian Boerstra: Well, I guess is what you showed me.
01:11:17 - Adrian Boerstra: Everybody just has tasks and they come back the next week and
report on what they got done.
01:11:22 - Michael Kianmahd: Laura puts it Laura has stuff that she wants to talk about.
01:11:28 - Michael Kianmahd: She's generally prepared.
01:11:31 - Michael Kianmahd: She'll ask questions.
01:11:34 - Michael Kianmahd: The person that mostly takes the responsibility is me for
making decisions, which I'm okay with.
01:11:43 - Michael Kianmahd: It's hard for me to prioritize because it's hard for me to know
what's what.
01:11:47 - Michael Kianmahd: The way that the information has been presented more
recently, the information is on a bunch of slides.
01:11:53 - Michael Kianmahd: Are these highest or not?
01:11:55 - Michael Kianmahd: I'm like, what else is on the list of things to do?
01:11:57 - Michael Kianmahd: What am I comparing it against?
01:12:01 - Michael Kianmahd: There's a list of 500 things.
01:12:03 - Michael Kianmahd: what else is highest, what's meaning?
01:12:05 - Michael Kianmahd: Like, I don't have the context to tell you.
01:12:08 - Adrian Boerstra: Okay.
01:12:09 - Michael Kianmahd: I kind of feel like that should be coming from Faye based on
responses we provide, you know?
01:12:16 - Adrian Boerstra: All right, let me make a proposal.
01:12:19 - Adrian Boerstra: So you've already kind of said that you're not sure about whether
you've got the right people on your team to be leaders in various areas.
01:12:26 - Adrian Boerstra: I can tell you from experience, people will take it as a bit of a kick
in the ass if you pull them into that meeting they feel like they'll feel like it's a promotion.
01:12:35 - Adrian Boerstra: If you kick them back out of that meeting, they'll feel like they just
got demoted.
01:12:42 - Adrian Boerstra: So why don't we start this?
01:12:44 - Adrian Boerstra: Why don't we start this way?
01:12:46 - Adrian Boerstra: Why don't you and I have a meeting?
01:12:51 - Adrian Boerstra: Me, you and Laura, once a week.
01:12:54 - Adrian Boerstra: I guess we can take the meeting like this is a recurring meeting.
01:12:58 - Adrian Boerstra: I'll join this one over the next few weeks.
01:13:00 - Adrian Boerstra: and we can start to run sort of that L10, level 10, sort of Eos
agenda, and you play the role of each one of those, you know, you're the leader of each value
stream.
01:13:14 - Adrian Boerstra: We'll work out what the metrics are, start reporting on those.
01:13:18 - Adrian Boerstra: That'll get you into that thought process and into that sort of
style of meeting.
01:13:25 - Adrian Boerstra: meeting, we'll have to come and ultimately kind of come up with
the rock star and use that process.
01:13:30 - Adrian Boerstra: But that'll get you into the flow of how that works.
01:13:33 - Adrian Boerstra: And then you can kind of start to have a little bit more to work
off of.
01:13:38 - Adrian Boerstra: The bottom line is coming into it, you don't have a clear idea on
who could fill those roles any way out of the existing organization.
01:13:45 - Adrian Boerstra: So on your accountability chart, you're the one manning all of
the roles that would normally be in that meeting anyway.
01:13:53 - Michael Kianmahd: I think we have supporting characters.
01:13:55 - Michael Kianmahd: I just don't think we have like fully formed Grab Life by the
Horn readers.
01:14:01 - Michael Kianmahd: Either because of resource constraints, like they're busy with
their day job and they just don't have enough capacity to grab life by the horns.
01:14:10 - Michael Kianmahd: Or skills gap.
01:14:12 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah, okay.
01:14:14 - Adrian Boerstra: Well maybe if we just start doing that meeting with you, you may
start to get into it and go, you know what, I think if I pulled somebody in, we don't want to
pull anybody into that meeting just haphazardly.
01:14:26 - Adrian Boerstra: If you pull them in, then they are on that leadership team.
01:14:31 - Michael Kianmahd: I view the steering committee currently as like tactical deci-
sion making.
01:14:34 - Adrian Boerstra: Let's let that meeting keep going the way it is.
01:14:38 - Adrian Boerstra: Don't make any changes there.
01:14:40 - Adrian Boerstra: We'll just do, for now, it would be incremental.
01:14:43 - Adrian Boerstra: So this would be a separate meeting that you're not having today.
01:14:46 - Adrian Boerstra: But let's start going through that as a like a leadership meeting.
01:14:51 - Adrian Boerstra: And that'll be the one where we draw it, we figure out what the
rocks are, figure out what the metrics are, it should go quicker because it's all you.
01:15:01 - Adrian Boerstra: But but that'll at least get you into it.
01:15:05 - Adrian Boerstra: And then you may decide, hey, let's trans let's start to use this at
the steering team.
01:15:10 - Adrian Boerstra: And then you'll have a better idea on how to implement that
internally.
01:15:14 - Adrian Boerstra: But at least it'll give us the structure so we start to have rocks
by value stream on a quarter by quarter basis.
01:15:21 - Adrian Boerstra: We know what the most important things are and we will report
every week on whether we're on track or off track on getting those rocks completed by the
end of that quarter.
01:15:29 - Adrian Boerstra: And that will drive our roadmap.
01:15:34 - Michael Kianmahd: Makes sense.
01:15:36 - Adrian Boerstra: And again, you have the view internally.
01:15:39 - Adrian Boerstra: You'll start to get an idea on out what the dynamic is in that
meeting and start to see whether or not that's, whether you actually have somebody who
could start to, you could move into that meeting and make them a part of that role.
01:15:52 - Adrian Boerstra: In the meantime, Eos kind of has like a way of doing things for
everything.
01:16:00 - Adrian Boerstra: There's, they have a tool called the People Analyzer with a whole
methodology behind that on determining whether or not somebody's right for a position.
01:16:08 - Adrian Boerstra: If you're interested in any of that, I've still got all my Eos materials
I could, or you could even look it up, Google it.
01:16:16 - Michael Kianmahd: I mean, I've already done a lot of this, but not Eos specific.
01:16:21 - Michael Kianmahd: Like, you've heard of Principles?
01:16:24 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah.
01:16:27 - Michael Kianmahd: So like, we license the software, it's like 100 bucks a person
a year.
01:16:31 - Michael Kianmahd: And these are all the people that were in the workshop
meeting.
01:16:34 - Adrian Boerstra: Okay.
01:16:36 - Michael Kianmahd: So like, my dad is, you know, the inventor.
01:16:38 - Michael Kianmahd: he's least like the technician and the implementer, which is
the feedback that I gave to you.
01:16:43 - Adrian Boerstra: Yep.
01:16:44 - Michael Kianmahd: He's like, this would be great, let's do it.
01:16:46 - Michael Kianmahd: And then he'll go in and I'm like
01:16:49 - Michael Kianmahd: am I Charles' inspire orchestrator in Perseario?
01:16:52 - Adrian Boerstra: Like me too.
01:16:55 - Michael Kianmahd: You're that way too?
01:16:56 - Adrian Boerstra: I am that way too.
01:16:58 - Adrian Boerstra: I made life hell for people in my company.
01:17:01 - Adrian Boerstra: And I know that.
01:17:02 - Adrian Boerstra: Like, don't get me wrong, when I say I made life hell, It's not like
I was a tyrant or anything like that, but I was definitely the guy who always had another idea
for the way we can improve things or do things.
01:17:14 - Adrian Boerstra: And I changed pretty quick, and it took some learning to realize
that not everybody sort of changes on a dime or just goes, hey, we're gonna do things a new
way.
01:17:26 - Adrian Boerstra: And that's very destabilizing for a lot of people.
01:17:29 - Adrian Boerstra: And you need all types in the organization.
01:17:32 - Adrian Boerstra: So I got a lot better at figuring out what everybody's good at and
01:17:39 - Adrian Boerstra: meeting them where they are.
01:17:41 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah, I mean, that's like a big theme in Vistage that I hear a
lot of people address.
01:17:53 - Michael Kianmahd: People also change over time.
01:17:56 - Michael Kianmahd: Like this is my profile.
01:18:01 - Michael Kianmahd: Commander, coach, orchestrator are like, If you know the top
personality type fits and I'm least the artisan and individualist Mm-hmm as few individualists
as possible and We have no individualists Which is great We have a ton of orchestrators.
01:18:23 - Michael Kianmahd: We have a strategist.
01:18:24 - Michael Kianmahd: We have an inspire.
01:18:25 - Michael Kianmahd: We have a You know, yeah, and that this was the workshop
group that I mentioned
01:18:36 - Michael Kianmahd: And then I have various teams, so like this is like the collec-
tions customer service team just to kind of see
01:18:48 - Michael Kianmahd: like for example, if like, like Hebert is that leader.
01:18:53 - Michael Kianmahd: So as the leader, he's the orchestrator and then he's got, he's
got orchestrators and a coach and no individualist.
01:19:33 - Adrian Boerstra: So if you identify your core values and the way that you kind of
come up with your core values is if you were to just sit down and go, who are the, think about
all of the people.
01:19:43 - Adrian Boerstra: First of all, if you could replicate those people, think about the
people in Maxim that you would go, man, if I could hire three more of that person, I would in
a second.
01:19:55 - Michael Kianmahd: And sending you a link to our values.
01:19:58 - Adrian Boerstra: Cool.
01:20:05 - Michael Kianmahd: We also took our values and we put them into the perfor-
mance review process.
01:20:10 - Michael Kianmahd: Yep, perfect.
01:20:11 - Michael Kianmahd: So we are reviewing people against values, not just on
outcomes.
01:20:17 - Adrian Boerstra: Excellent.
01:20:17 - Adrian Boerstra: That's very Eos as well.
01:20:20 - Adrian Boerstra: So that's the idea is your values are something you would hire
and fire people based on.
01:20:25 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah.
01:20:26 - Adrian Boerstra: And so if somebody is aligned with your core values, then they're
a right person.
01:20:31 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah.
01:20:32 - Adrian Boerstra: Then the question is, well, are they in the right seat?
01:20:36 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah.
01:20:37 - Adrian Boerstra: And then the three things that Eos says you should say about
anybody to determine if they're in the right seat is, do they get it?
01:20:48 - Adrian Boerstra: And getting it means, do they get the role and what is needed?
01:20:54 - Adrian Boerstra: Do they intuitively?
01:20:57 - Adrian Boerstra: It's like the x-factor.
01:20:59 - Adrian Boerstra: Do they get it?
01:21:01 - Adrian Boerstra: Do they want it?
01:21:03 - Adrian Boerstra: So is this a role that they would want?
01:21:06 - Adrian Boerstra: And then the third thing is, do they have the capacity to actually
do it?
01:21:10 - Adrian Boerstra: So sometimes somebody gets it, they want it, and they're not
quite ready for it, but you're like, no, they do have a capacity to get there.
01:21:21 - Adrian Boerstra: So there might be some stretch.
01:21:25 - Adrian Boerstra: Capacity has more to do with, could be day-to-day lifestyle, could
be ability to learn the things that will close that gap.
01:21:34 - Adrian Boerstra: But those are the three things.
01:21:35 - Adrian Boerstra: G, W, C, do they get it, do they want it, do they have the capacity
to do it?
01:21:40 - Adrian Boerstra: And so if you can say that they're the right person in the company
because they align with their core values, and they get it, want it, and have the capacity to
do a certain role, then the idea is you can move them into that role.
01:21:53 - Adrian Boerstra: So it gives you a very kind of clear way of just, you know, It's still
subjective, but it's just a way of thinking about it.
01:22:02 - Adrian Boerstra: So if you're looking at your leadership roles and thinking about
people in the company, you first have to go, Ok, let's define what the seat is.
01:22:10 - Adrian Boerstra: What's the role that they want?
01:22:12 - Adrian Boerstra: And you've got job descriptions already.
01:22:14 - Adrian Boerstra: So then if you want to think about three different people for a
role, just ask yourself, hey, do they get it?
01:22:21 - Adrian Boerstra: Do they want it?
01:22:22 - Adrian Boerstra: Do they have the capacity to do it?
01:22:24 - Adrian Boerstra: And assuming that they're in your company already, so you
consider them to be a good fit for the company, then it gives you kind of a quick way of
saying, are they right for the role?
01:22:35 - Adrian Boerstra: But that rides sort of parallel or above and beyond just the sort
of personality fit that you've got laid out there.
01:22:45 - Adrian Boerstra: Eos recommend Colby for doing the personality fit stuff and team
building.
01:22:54 - Adrian Boerstra: I don't know if you've ever used Colby.
01:22:55 - Michael Kianmahd: Colby, haven't even heard of it.
01:22:57 - Adrian Boerstra: They're actually a client of Faze too, as it turns out.
01:23:01 - Adrian Boerstra: K-o-l-b-e.
01:23:03 - Michael Kianmahd: K-o-l-b-e, okay.
01:23:04 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah, so Colby was started up by, are you familiar with Wonder-
lic?
01:23:08 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah.
01:23:09 - Adrian Boerstra: So Colby was started up by Wonderlic's daughter.
01:23:14 - Michael Kianmahd: No way.
01:23:15 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah, so the difference with Colby, it's very interesting.
01:23:21 - Adrian Boerstra: So with Colby, there's no, what made it unique for me using Colby
was other personalities, they like wonder like we'll just score you overall.
01:23:34 - Adrian Boerstra: And they might say, you are, no, you're not good at, I don't know,
you're not good at change, right?
01:23:48 - Adrian Boerstra: Colby would, Colby looks at everything on a spectrum and sees
every personality is valuable.
01:23:55 - Adrian Boerstra: So somebody who might be not change is probably a good
stabilizer within the organization.
01:24:01 - Adrian Boerstra: So they will gravitate towards trying to keep the same things
the same and making sure that it's predictable and that, you know, we're not changing on a
whim.
01:24:10 - Adrian Boerstra: Or somebody who's a fast changer will always be pulling in the
other direction.
01:24:15 - Adrian Boerstra: And Colby says, hey, you need both.
01:24:18 - Adrian Boerstra: And one of the other things is other personality tests that I've
done, I've looked at me, for example, and said, hey, you need to not procrastinate things.
01:24:29 - Adrian Boerstra: You're really bad at that.
01:24:32 - Adrian Boerstra: You're always procrastinating.
01:24:34 - Adrian Boerstra: Colby would be more likely to say, hey, you're the type of person
that is not, you make decisions quickly, you act quickly on urgent things.
01:24:45 - Adrian Boerstra: That's where you're at your best.
01:24:47 - Adrian Boerstra: there are other people in the organization who can do really well
with planning over a long period of time.
01:24:51 - Adrian Boerstra: You should be focused on the kind of things that need someone
to act quickly.
01:24:56 - Adrian Boerstra: And so Colby really takes this approach of, hey
01:25:02 - Adrian Boerstra: there's a place for every personality type, but you should work
where your strengths are.
01:25:09 - Adrian Boerstra: So I've found a lot of, I guess a lot of other personality tests I've
looked at encourage employees to be something they're not.
01:25:15 - Adrian Boerstra: it looks at what they probably would be maybe weaker in, and it
focuses on that as a weakness, whereas Colby focuses, looks at those things and says, hey,
that's not a weakness.
01:25:26 - Adrian Boerstra: In fact, if you're somebody who procrastinates all the time, it
means that you're really good at probably pivoting and improvising and being effective when
you don't have a lot of time to prep.
01:25:39 - Adrian Boerstra: And so it has a way of saying, okay, you need to pair these people
up together, but watch who you pair together, because if someone is too far apart on some
of these action modes, then there's going to be more friction than otherwise.
01:25:56 - Michael Kianmahd: Makes sense.
01:25:58 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah, but it's an interesting, Colby is interesting.
01:26:02 - Adrian Boerstra: I think all of that stuff is good.
01:26:03 - Adrian Boerstra: That was good, but the right person, right seat is the Eos thing
of do they get it, want to have the capacity to do it.
01:26:13 - Adrian Boerstra: That's probably a little bit more functional qualification as
opposed to examining the dynamics of the team.
01:26:20 - Michael Kianmahd: For sure.
01:26:22 - Adrian Boerstra: Anyhow, so yeah, if you like that idea, maybe we can start running
that kind of an agenda.
01:26:28 - Adrian Boerstra: Normally on an executive team meeting, it's scheduled as a 90
minute meeting it starts on time, ends on time, and you take 90 minutes.
01:26:36 - Adrian Boerstra: I feel like if we're starting with a, you know, just me, you, and
Laura, we probably won't need 90 minutes for each meeting to do this.
01:26:47 - Michael Kianmahd: I, yeah, I mean, I'm curious how this will fit into tomorrow's
conversation.
01:26:53 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah, so am I, to be honest.
01:26:54 - Adrian Boerstra: So, like, here's my thing is I don't like driving an agenda off of,
hey, we need more resources.
01:27:01 - Adrian Boerstra: I'd rather drive an agenda off of, here's what our plans are, here's
what we want to accomplish.
01:27:05 - Michael Kianmahd: You're right.
01:27:06 - Michael Kianmahd: I should say that I thought that was already clear.
01:27:12 - Michael Kianmahd: I thought our objectives and what we were trying to accom-
plish is clear.
01:27:17 - Michael Kianmahd: And we have already sort of, we talked about the big picture
of what we're trying to accomplish, and we're sort of.
01:27:24 - Adrian Boerstra: We do have what we want to accomplish lined up.
01:27:29 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah.
01:27:30 - Adrian Boerstra: We do have that.
01:27:32 - Adrian Boerstra: I think what was missing for me is feeling like.
01:27:38 - Michael Kianmahd: It's not it's not beautifully organized buttoned up and wrapped
in beautiful wrapping paper and a beautiful bow.
01:27:44 - Michael Kianmahd: That's for sure.
01:27:46 - Adrian Boerstra: One of your asks was value and that's the part for me that's
missing.
01:27:51 - Adrian Boerstra: I feel like we have a list of initiatives.
01:27:52 - Adrian Boerstra: We have them sort of mapped across as milestones that we
want to get done.
01:28:00 - Adrian Boerstra: But I think what's ultimately missing for me is like a framework
where, because I don't think the roadmap shouldn't be like a knee-jerk reaction to anything.
01:28:11 - Adrian Boerstra: The roadmap should be a by-product of an ongoing process.
01:28:15 - Adrian Boerstra: And that's what I want to feel like we've got.
01:28:19 - Adrian Boerstra: And so by starting with the, Like having rocks for the quarter and
problems that we're trying to solve and metrics that we're trying to improve on being the
drivers for those things.
01:28:29 - Adrian Boerstra: I think that will help to complete the picture.
01:28:32 - Adrian Boerstra: And I actually think it'll validate a lot of what we already have in
the in the road map.
01:28:36 - Adrian Boerstra: roadmap?
01:28:40 - Michael Kianmahd: So let's do this, Adrian.
01:28:41 - Michael Kianmahd: Let's have our call tomorrow.
01:28:43 - Michael Kianmahd: Like, I'm with you on its potential value.
01:28:47 - Michael Kianmahd: How you laid it out is how I have it in my mind.
01:28:51 - Michael Kianmahd: Okay.
01:28:52 - Michael Kianmahd: And I think my failure is what you've heard from me directly
was just the technical aspects of what we need to help with.
01:28:58 - Michael Kianmahd: I didn't do a good enough job providing, you know, including
you as we would have, actually as like maybe an employee.
01:29:05 - Michael Kianmahd: and probably some of that is the distance, some of that is like
the limited hours, some of that is like how the relationship has evolved over time.
01:29:11 - Michael Kianmahd: We can always reframe it.
01:29:13 - Michael Kianmahd: I think tomorrow's conversation is part of that discussion.
01:29:16 - Michael Kianmahd: What you're saying is definitely a big part of that discussion.
01:29:20 - Michael Kianmahd: So let's see how we can get there.
01:29:22 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah, I wanna show you something real quick.
01:29:25 - Michael Kianmahd: I got one with an attorney, that's the only.
01:29:28 - Adrian Boerstra: Okay, this will only take a second.
01:29:30 - Adrian Boerstra: Sure.
01:29:31 - Adrian Boerstra: Let me share my screen.
01:29:32 - Michael Kianmahd: Yep.
01:29:35 - Adrian Boerstra: I think you have to stop sharing for it too.
01:29:38 - Michael Kianmahd: I think you're sharing right now.
01:29:41 - Adrian Boerstra: Oh, am I?
