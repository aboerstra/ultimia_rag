[EXT] FW: Maxim x Faye Planning Transcript
00:01 - Laura: I have two.
00:05 - Laura: Actually, I can keep, I'll keep this quick.
00:08 - Laura: So, first off, the Pilate duplicate, did you see my email with like the pricing for
that?
00:14 - Michael Kianmahd: I received it.
00:15 - Michael Kianmahd: I just haven't had time to review it in depth.
00:19 - Laura: Is that price okay?
00:21 - Michael Kianmahd: Didn't even have a chance to look at the price.
00:24 - Michael Kianmahd: I just, I didn't even open the email yet.
00:26 - Laura: Okay, do you want me to just skip that and introduce you to a new and he can
send you us like I figured I'd let you know the price before I introduced you in case you were
like it's not in the budget.
00:38 - Michael Kianmahd: But I'm trying to pull it up.
00:42 - Michael Kianmahd: Plotty Yeah.
00:43 - Michael Kianmahd: $4300 a year.
00:45 - Laura: Yeah.
00:47 - Michael Kianmahd: Ah.
00:52 - Michael Kianmahd: Okay.
00:56 - Michael Kianmahd: So high level question.
01:00 - Michael Kianmahd: How many Duke catcher pieces of software are there?
01:07 - Laura: There's probably, there's quite a few out there.
01:10 - Michael Kianmahd: Okay.
01:11 - Michael Kianmahd: And do we have one right now that's currently in Salesforce?
01:16 - Laura: Literally, it's called Duke capture.
01:18 - Laura: I think it's free.
01:19 - Laura: It's terrible, hence why you need a paid one.
01:26 - Michael Kianmahd: The dupe catcher that we have in Salesforce, is it the one that
comes standard or is it a free app that we got?
01:36 - Michael Kianmahd: I have no idea.
01:37 - Laura: It's an app, but it's a catcher, not an actioner, plotted to duplication actions.
01:45 - Laura: in like they're not even in the same you can't compare them it's not apples for
apples okay
01:53 - Laura: um if you want alternatives to plotty i could find them um to see if there's
something that's
02:00 - Laura: a little bit more like in there's like a price range or something yeah i have a bias
for
02:07 - Michael Kianmahd: like a shopping be making sure we're not buying software we're
not going to really use properly
02:13 - Michael Kianmahd: or fully.
02:15 - Laura: Okay, I plan on using it pretty fully but I can still ground.
02:21 - Michael Kianmahd: I kind of want to rely on your advice here.
02:25 - Laura: So let me put it this way.
02:29 - Laura: Plotty is a tool that I have other customers who use it so I know it.
02:33 - Laura: I know how it works.
02:35 - Laura: I know how like I can pretty much just hit the ground running.
02:38 - Laura: So it reduces the time that way.
02:42 - Laura: It will meet all of the things that you're trying to do.
02:47 - Laura: Other tools, they could be cheaper, but it'll end up that I'll probably have to like
learn it.
02:53 - Laura: You know what I mean?
02:54 - Laura: And that causes time on services.
02:57 - Laura: So that's why I chose Plotty.
03:04 - Laura: And they're good, pretty good to work with too.
03:08 - Laura: So yeah.
03:10 - Laura: That's that's really what it comes down to, but I am happy to like do some
comparisons and stuff, but that is also like that will probably take some time.
03:18 - Laura: So if you're happy with that, I can give you some alternative.
03:22 - Michael Kianmahd: I'm hearing complaints about dupe catching, so I think we should
prioritize this.
03:27 - Laura: Yeah, this one will actually go in and I can like schedule jobs and it'll just
actually like fix the duplicates for you as well is you can embed it in Apis and flows and stuff.
03:37 - Laura: So it'll take the next level.
03:44 - Laura: Ok, so if you're good with that, Ok to introduce you to Anu?
03:48 - Michael Kianmahd: Right, Vladi?
03:49 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah.
03:51 - Laura: Ok, sounds good.
03:54 - Laura: Oh, gosh, sorry.
03:55 - Laura: Slack's going crazy.
03:56 - Laura: Next one is, so we've got a call.
04:01 - Laura: I think Caleb scheduled it or he's trying to for Tuesday.
04:05 - Laura: Everybody was out this week.
04:07 - Laura: So I'm meeting with Ross tomorrow to talk about resourcing.
04:09 - Laura: I have no updates on that front, unfortunately.
04:12 - Laura: I am still just like working away at it, but otherwise we'll have to talk about that
resourcing stuff, project planning, all that on Tuesday.
04:21 - Laura: The only other thing I have for you today that I wanted to talk about was
industries from our steering committee call.
04:29 - Laura: I don't know if this is a wider discussion.
04:33 - Laura: I'll start with you.
04:35 - Laura: Basically, all I want to know, share my screen.
04:45 - Laura: So
04:48 - Laura: on accounts, We will want to be able to classify our industry in those for
industries that you're going to be using for scoring.
05:05 - Laura: Do you need...
05:08 - Laura: I just used recreation.
05:09 - Laura: What's the fourth one?
05:12 - Laura: So, you've got agriculture, construction, transportation, and vocational.
05:17 - Laura: Vocational, thank you.
05:18 - Laura: So, I just used recreation because that was one of the like standard ones just
to replace that.
05:23 - Laura: Do you only want those four as available options?
05:28 - Michael Kianmahd: No, I think we need an other.
05:31 - Laura: Okay, and then like a text field.
05:33 - Michael Kianmahd: I think we need real estate and we need other.
05:36 - Laura: Okay, so agriculture, construction, vocational, yeah.
05:42 - Laura: Vocational, transportation, real estate, and then other.
05:45 - Michael Kianmahd: I think transportation, so it's vocational, trucking, and then over
the road trucking.
05:51 - Michael Kianmahd: And I think those are different.
05:54 - Michael Kianmahd: Okay, hang on here.
05:55 - Laura: Are you going to be scoring all those as different models?
05:59 - Michael Kianmahd: Those are four models.
06:00 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah.
06:00 - Michael Kianmahd: So over the road trucking is one model.
06:05 - Laura: Okay.
06:06 - Michael Kianmahd: Are you curious about any level of detail just so for your, for your
imagination?
06:11 - Laura: Not right now.
06:12 - Michael Kianmahd: No.
06:13 - Laura: Okay.
06:14 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah.
06:14 - Michael Kianmahd: The second is vocational trucking.
06:17 - Laura: Okay.
06:18 - Michael Kianmahd: The third is construction.
06:21 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah.
06:21 - Michael Kianmahd: The fourth is agricultural.
06:27 - Michael Kianmahd: And the fourth is, or fifth is Corey Gambello.
06:33 - Cory Gambello: Oh, hey Corey.
06:34 - Cory Gambello: That's the best one.
06:37 - Cory Gambello: Okay, wait, hang on.
06:39 - Michael Kianmahd: Auto approvals.
06:41 - Laura: I've only got, hang on, I don't have enough here.
06:44 - Laura: So over the road trekking, vocational trekking, construction, agricultural, real
estate, and the other.
06:50 - Michael Kianmahd: Correct.
06:51 - Laura: Okay.
06:52 - Laura: We did talk about them when I was on site.
06:54 - Laura: I've got like enough of the knowledge to know.
06:57 - Laura: I just need to know these for now.
06:59 - Laura: So those are the ones that are gonna be available on our debtor lesser
guarantors.
07:04 - Laura: Do we need to classify referral partners or vendors or service providers with
industries?
07:10 - Laura: We don't score them, but do we care about, no?
07:14 - Laura: No.
07:15 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah, and then on the model itself, I just actually got off a call
talking about this.
07:21 - Michael Kianmahd: On the vocational model, Yeah, maybe on the Otr model.
07:26 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah, so Otr there are subtypes There's like long haul.
07:31 - Michael Kianmahd: So these are like semi trucks That are the heaviest of duty They
usually have like a bed in the back because these guys are driving across the country and
sleeping in their truck at truck stops Mm-hmm.
07:44 - Michael Kianmahd: There is a second version of that which is called like a day cab
where it's It's equally as heavy duty, but the cab itself is shorter, and there's no bed in the
back.
07:58 - Michael Kianmahd: And that's a different use case.
07:59 - Michael Kianmahd: Those are people that are doing pork to warehouse, pork to
warehouse kind of runs.
08:06 - Michael Kianmahd: They're just doing local delivery to your grocery store kind of
people.
08:13 - Michael Kianmahd: And those are the main two types.
08:15 - Michael Kianmahd: And then in vocational
08:18 - Michael Kianmahd: we're gonna have subtypes.
08:20 - Michael Kianmahd: And we're currently working on defining those a little bit better.
08:23 - Michael Kianmahd: But those might be like towing, utilities
08:30 - Michael Kianmahd: waste management, construction.
08:38 - Michael Kianmahd: And those are not defined yet.
08:40 - Michael Kianmahd: So those are kind of draft ones that I just gave you.
08:44 - Michael Kianmahd: So just keep that on the roadmap to plug in that data at some
point.
08:50 - Michael Kianmahd: Okay.
08:51 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah.
08:51 - Michael Kianmahd: And for scoring purposes, because that model is going to assign
points because some industries under vocational are riskier and some are less risky.
09:02 - Michael Kianmahd: The model is going to assign points based on level of risk of
sub-industry for vocational.
09:06 - Michael Kianmahd: So somebody might be buying a vocational truck, but it's a tow
truck, and that might be medium
09:13 - Michael Kianmahd: Somebody might be buying a dump truck and it's for construc-
tion and it's low risk
09:20 - Michael Kianmahd: Mm-hmm and the model output is going to be a little bit different
and a dump truck is not something that should be scored on
09:25 - Michael Kianmahd: The construction model or Otp model Otr model because it's
actually a vocational piece of equipment
09:31 - Michael Kianmahd: Does that make sense people drive that truck for a living
essentially so it's but it's not Otr and it's not construction
09:38 - Michael Kianmahd: It's vocational
09:39 - Michael Kianmahd: subcategory construction
09:42 - Laura: Okay, so one
09:48 - Laura: the debtor can only be one of those, any of those things, right?
09:55 - Michael Kianmahd: The debtor, yeah.
09:58 - Laura: Okay, and we, do we care, we just so we don't care about.
10:09 - Laura: Sorry, for vendors referral partners and service providers.
10:15 - Laura: Do we care about knowing, like, in general what industry they're in.
10:19 - Laura: So this is going back to like standard industries where you have like trans-
portation or.
10:24 - Laura: Wow, food and beverage.
10:25 - Laura: Like, do you care about any of that?
10:27 - Laura: Or should we just like completely remove it?
10:30 - Michael Kianmahd: Can you ask again?
10:32 - Laura: So for vendors and referral partners and service providers, technically they
can have different industries.
10:38 - Laura: Do you care about classifying those types of accounts with an industry?
10:43 - Michael Kianmahd: No.
10:45 - Laura: Okay.
10:47 - Michael Kianmahd: I mean, it would be nice, like, it doesn't hurt, like, but service
provider, industry, I think you already have service providers, subtype like repo, agent.
11:00 - Michael Kianmahd: I think that's where that data is going to be captured.
11:03 - Laura: Now, those are like types.
11:05 - Laura: This is like standard.
11:06 - Laura: A standard industry list is like marketing, agriculture, transportation, those are
like standard industries.
11:14 - Laura: You'll have a service provider.
11:16 - Laura: One of them could potentially be in finance and one could be transportation.
11:21 - Laura: Do you care about classifying that industry on those service providers?
11:28 - Michael Kianmahd: I would, my guts no, but I'd probably want to ask everyone else.
11:33 - Laura: Okay, perfect.
11:35 - Laura: Okay, I'll put that in the steering committee.
11:37 - Laura: Ask regarding, and then have you made a decision or is it still in progress,
whether or not you're going to like score every deal for all the models or just based off of the
industry of the debtor?
11:54 - Laura: That was up in the air when I was on site.
12:00 - Michael Kianmahd: Um.
12:03 - Michael Kianmahd: Let's punt on that not ready to answer the question, but.
12:06 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah, but just 1 thing to make sure so.
12:13 - Michael Kianmahd: Instead of calling it because I think, you know, I want to name
things what they are.
12:17 - Michael Kianmahd: I don't I want to leave like, little room for assumption or people
just.
12:21 - Michael Kianmahd: Making the wrong inference.
12:22 - Laura: Okay.
12:24 - Michael Kianmahd: But instead of calling that category industry, should we call it
industry scorecard?
12:31 - Laura: You can call it whatever you want to call it.
12:33 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah.
12:34 - Michael Kianmahd: Let's do that.
12:37 - Michael Kianmahd: Because we're getting rid of opportunity record types, right?
12:41 - Laura: No, you are keeping them.
12:42 - Laura: That's your heavy equipment, structured financing, real estate.
12:48 - Michael Kianmahd: We're changing them, I should say.
12:50 - Michael Kianmahd: Ok, so yeah so.
12:54 - Michael Kianmahd: So basically the way this would work is.
12:58 - Michael Kianmahd: You have a opportunity record type that gets away from the Bltr
paradigm.
13:04 - Michael Kianmahd: And then that that's what sets up the structure for what fields
get populated.
13:10 - Michael Kianmahd: Yes, and then inside of there.
13:14 - Michael Kianmahd: You have to populate which scorecard you want to use.
13:19 - Michael Kianmahd: And we will have a, you know, how it says industry right there.
13:23 - Michael Kianmahd: We'll have that say, industry scorecard, and then whoever's doing
intake would have to basically select that, and they could run the credit model.
13:34 - Michael Kianmahd: And then when the credit team looks at it, they could just verify
that the correct scorecard was used.
13:40 - Michael Kianmahd: They're happy with the output.
13:42 - Michael Kianmahd: They could theoretically change the scorecard, rerun a scoring
engine, still get the record, those differences will be shown.
13:56 - Michael Kianmahd: Then whichever the final one is, that's the one they go with, that's
the one they do the pricing model off of, etc.
14:03 - Laura: Okay.
14:05 - Laura: This goes as contradictory to what I was asking before.
14:08 - Laura: The debtor itself, you have an account.
14:11 - Laura: Let's just say that's your business, that's your applicant.
14:16 - Laura: They will have an industry.
14:17 - Laura: they're only in one industry, they're not in multiple.
14:22 - Laura: So do you want to change the industry?
14:27 - Laura: No, I actually don't think you'd wanna do that.
14:29 - Laura: So you're gonna apply your industry to the account, but then on a deal, you
want the ability to run a different scoring model to see if you get a better outcome.
14:41 - Laura: Is that correct?
14:44 - Michael Kianmahd: I would say it a little differently, but I think you're directionally
correct.
14:48 - Laura: Okay.
14:48 - Laura: Because we wouldn't want to just change the industry of the account like the
customer.
14:53 - Laura: Yeah.
14:53 - Michael Kianmahd: I'm actually delineating.
14:56 - Michael Kianmahd: Like the term industry, to me is a non-scoring engine related
topic.
15:05 - Laura: That's what I mean.
15:05 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah.
15:06 - Laura: It's just defining the customer.
15:08 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah.
15:09 - Michael Kianmahd: If we wanted to find the customer per industry, we should do that
in a non-scorecard related way.
15:15 - Michael Kianmahd: We shouldn't try to dual purpose it is what I'm trying to say.
15:18 - Laura: So my original question had to do with customers, not the scorecard.
15:24 - Laura: So I've got the scoring stuff.
15:26 - Michael Kianmahd: That's fine.
15:28 - Laura: Is the answer for the accounts different then?
15:33 - Laura: Like, would you say so if you've got customer Abc, applicant, Joe blogs,
whatever, would his industry be over the road trucking?
15:42 - Michael Kianmahd: Can I try to explain it like in layman's terms?
15:45 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah.
15:46 - Michael Kianmahd: If somebody applies, they're a trucking company.
15:51 - Laura: Yeah.
15:53 - Michael Kianmahd: An account gets created.
15:57 - Michael Kianmahd: Are
16:01 - Michael Kianmahd: there account record types?
16:03 - Michael Kianmahd: There are, right?
16:04 - Laura: Yeah.
16:04 - Laura: Those are your debtor.
16:05 - Laura: Okay.
16:08 - Michael Kianmahd: So that's going to be the account record type.
16:10 - Michael Kianmahd: Okay.
16:13 - Michael Kianmahd: Nothing to do with scoring model, but industry is selected
transportation.
16:16 - Michael Kianmahd: Then an opportunity record type is created, and the opportunity
record type is heavy equipment financing.
16:25 - Michael Kianmahd: Then in that, the industry is transportation, and then industry
scorecard would have to be selected, and it's going to be selected as over the road trucking.
16:40 - Michael Kianmahd: And then that's gonna be what tags which scorecard gets
selected for credit modeling purposes separate example Somebody applies Okay It's a
marketing company Okay, okay, and the marketing company is You know some person that
has equity in their home.
17:01 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah Account record type debtor lesser gets created industry
marketing opportunity record type real estate, industry scorecard real estate.
17:21 - Michael Kianmahd: There's no scoring engine.
17:22 - Michael Kianmahd: There's no score deal to click.
17:26 - Michael Kianmahd: Eventually, you may have that.
17:29 - Michael Kianmahd: That's how I probably want it to function.
17:31 - Laura: Okay, that answers my question.
17:32 - Michael Kianmahd: Awesome.
17:35 - Laura: All right.
17:36 - Laura: I don't.
17:39 - Laura: Oh, I did follow up.
17:40 - Laura: I know.
17:40 - Laura: I'll one more minute.
17:41 - Laura: So trans union, trans union scoring.
17:44 - Laura: We are not sending the data to kin.
17:48 - Laura: I don't know if you want me to do anything with that.
17:50 - Laura: So I don't know if you remember, we like kind of discuss that.
17:53 - Michael Kianmahd: I don't think we need to do anything about it.
17:55 - Michael Kianmahd: I think we should to just flag it next time we talk to Ken when we
talk about integrating everything.
18:01 - Laura: Ok, is that something that you want to pursue?
18:05 - Laura: Or are you going down a path of, we're not going to be using Transunion
anymore?
18:14 - Michael Kianmahd: I think we want to just, I think we want the ability to use
Transunion.
18:18 - Michael Kianmahd: But I think this is a broader conversation, and it's a very small
percentage of the population.
18:22 - Michael Kianmahd: Ok, perfect.
18:24 - Michael Kianmahd: I would have to, I want to talk to Jay about this, and like,
maybe this is something we can talk about on Monday, and just be like, when are you using
Transunion, why are you using it, what are you doing with information?
18:37 - Michael Kianmahd: Do you realize that if you are using Transunion, it doesn't
correlate right now to the scoring engine?
18:45 - Michael Kianmahd: That should be like a gut check, like how many times are you
using it type question?
18:49 - Laura: Yep, okay, I can do that.
18:51 - Michael Kianmahd: Awesome.
18:52 - Laura: Okay, that was all that was honestly that's the extent to my agenda for today.
18:57 - Michael Kianmahd: I have a question for both of you before we wrap.
18:59 - Michael Kianmahd: So we have our time scheduled for the 24th.
19:03 - Michael Kianmahd: At 9 o'clock.
19:05 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah, Caleb set that up for us.
19:10 - Michael Kianmahd: Is this so what's the what's the agenda for that?
19:14 - Laura: I think they would just want to come back to you and just like, after all of our
roadmap planning.
19:20 - Laura: I'm having a conversation internally with, around resources tomorrow to like
see what's feasible based on like schedules and all that stuff.
19:30 - Laura: Then I'll update that and give you like, these are the actual dates where
everything will fit in.
19:37 - Laura: And then we'll look at like, how many hours is that per month or whatever?
19:42 - Laura: And then that conversation will be like, how do we structure your Axie or
whatever to fit, to suit?
19:48 - Laura: Does that is that right, Corey?
19:51 - Cory Gambello: Correct.
19:51 - Cory Gambello: Yeah, so it's reviewing the roadmap items, hours associated, the plan
currently, and then options moving forward to add hours into that plan as well, Michael.
20:06 - Michael Kianmahd: I'm just pulling up my notes.
20:07 - Michael Kianmahd: Give me one second.
20:10 - Cory Gambello: Does that align with your expectation, Michael?
20:12 - Cory Gambello: Seems like you're getting another.
20:15 - Michael Kianmahd: That's what I'm confirming for myself.
20:18 - Michael Kianmahd: So yeah, yeah.
20:23 - Michael Kianmahd: Laura, remember the notes that I sent you last week?
20:27 - Laura: Yep.
20:28 - Michael Kianmahd: Where I was like talking about the variables, the constraints, like
what I need to know and the details.
20:34 - Michael Kianmahd: Will all that be populated and clear?
20:38 - Laura: Not a one thing.
20:40 - Laura: Adrian's out till July 1st or June 30th.
20:44 - Laura: He's pretty needed for that.
20:47 - Laura: It's his tool.
20:50 - Michael Kianmahd: It's his tool.
20:54 - Michael Kianmahd: Okay, so this was, Cory, I don't know if you've seen this.
21:02 - Laura: So, hang on, that's not necessary.
21:04 - Laura: So we already have, like, the cost is easy to get because once we know like
hours and rate, we can get that.
21:13 - Laura: The impact value, is that not like the value streams?
21:22 - Laura: Like a lot of this is the dependencies we don't have.
21:27 - Laura: There's some of the like kind of add-ons in there, but like overall, I feel like we
had the priority, the value, like the time, all that kind of stuff.
21:38 - Michael Kianmahd: I think it wasn't confirmed.
21:40 - Michael Kianmahd: I think you were gonna do some more work on it.
21:42 - Laura: Yeah, oh yeah, so that's what I'm saying, is I need to, I'm having conversations
internally tomorrow around like who's available and when, so that I know when I can actually
deliver.
21:52 - Laura: I'll do all that and then we'll talk.
21:54 - Laura: But like some of these, like we're not gonna have the tool updated to show
dependencies and stuff by Tuesday.
22:00 - Laura: That's if you want all of this, it's some of it's gonna have to wait, so.
22:04 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah, I just, I'm gonna say something, Laura, it's gonna sound
familiar, but Cora, I'm gonna say for your, mainly your benefit, just for context and clarity.
22:12 - Michael Kianmahd: So, like, big picture, I wanna be able to look at a document and
know where we're gonna land with a high degree of certainty, by X date, at what cost, who
our resources are gonna be, what the dependencies are, our priorities.
22:37 - Michael Kianmahd: So if we have to start shaving the budget down, because it's just
too expensive, we can't afford it, we got to stretch it.
22:43 - Michael Kianmahd: This ability on what to adjust if needed.
22:48 - Michael Kianmahd: Okay.
22:49 - Michael Kianmahd: So if you look at the last two bullet points on what I need to know,
like I just want to know, like assuming they had the resources and it was possible, resources
and it was possible.
23:03 - Michael Kianmahd: What is the most aggressive possible timelines, time budget, and
cost budget that we could achieve all the things we set out to achieve?
23:13 - Michael Kianmahd: What levers each of us can pull to speed it up or slow it down?
23:19 - Michael Kianmahd: Other solutions Faye might offer to accomplish this.
23:23 - Michael Kianmahd: So Cori, on that specific thing, I don't know like you know Freeing
up Laura's time or adding more engineering horsepower or Having Adrian spend 10 hours a
week.
23:38 - Michael Kianmahd: I don't know how what magic You apply, but those are all you
know Things that are I guess on the table and then accountability reporting which has been
probably the biggest missing link Like, you know, we set to do this by this date at this cost.
23:58 - Michael Kianmahd: How did we land?
23:59 - Michael Kianmahd: Why didn't we make it?
24:00 - Michael Kianmahd: Who fucked up?
24:04 - Michael Kianmahd: You know, at the end of the day, we're running a business, right?
24:07 - Michael Kianmahd: Yep, absolutely.
24:09 - Cory Gambello: I have a prep call with him tomorrow.
24:12 - Cory Gambello: Caleb's gonna be setting that up internally, Michael.
24:14 - Cory Gambello: If we do not have all the details that you're requesting here, we may
push that meeting out.
24:20 - Cory Gambello: So just to make sure that we come to the table everything.
24:23 - Cory Gambello: So I'll let you know and Caleb know and then we'll readjust that
meeting as well.
24:28 - Cory Gambello: I may need to readjust that meeting in itself.
24:32 - Cory Gambello: I thought it was on Monday but I just saw that it was on Tuesday.
24:35 - Cory Gambello: I'm on site all day Tuesday so I may want him just to push that out
later in the week anyways.
24:42 - Cory Gambello: So we can take a look at that and look at your available schedule.
24:44 - Cory Gambello: I'll have them coordinate that with you as well Michael.
24:46 - Cory Gambello: Okay.
24:47 - Cory Gambello: But if we're gonna be coming to the table I want to make sure we
have all this detail for you.
24:55 - Michael Kianmahd: I'm just curious for myself.
24:57 - Michael Kianmahd: So I met with Dave May 1st, which is when we first started
discussing this with Dave.
25:11 - Michael Kianmahd: So just from like a, you know, I think One of Laura's complaints,
which is valid, is she's spending a lot of time putting this document together and she's not
actually doing the work.
25:23 - Michael Kianmahd: It becomes counterproductive to actually achieving stuff.
25:26 - Michael Kianmahd: So I think she's been more heads down in trying to achieve stuff.
25:30 - Michael Kianmahd: And I think she asked Adrian and you and Dave for help.
25:35 - Michael Kianmahd: So I don't want to lose sight of what we've been trying to do with
a little bit more horsepower for the last, how many weeks has it been now?
25:43 - Michael Kianmahd: Seven weeks.
25:47 - Michael Kianmahd: So.
25:49 - Michael Kianmahd: You know.
25:52 - Michael Kianmahd: I just was trying to lay out for you and I can share this with you.
25:55 - Michael Kianmahd: Corey, would you like me to forward that email to you or has
Laura already forwarded?
25:58 - Cory Gambello: That would be helpful.
25:59 - Cory Gambello: That'd be helpful.
26:00 - Cory Gambello: I believe I got that forwarded to me in the past, but it'll just be top of
the inbox if you forward it to me.
26:06 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah, you want me to forward to Dave as well?
26:11 - Cory Gambello: Yeah, if you want to see.
26:13 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah.
26:14 - Michael Kianmahd: And what about Caleb?
26:18 - Cory Gambello: Yes, regardless, it'll make it to get I'll make sure it makes it to him,
but.
26:25 - Michael Kianmahd: Okay.
26:28 - Michael Kianmahd: So, I, like, I'm agnostic to what platform you use.
26:32 - Michael Kianmahd: It could honestly be Excel.
26:34 - Michael Kianmahd: I don't really care.
26:36 - Michael Kianmahd: I don't think it should be.
26:40 - Michael Kianmahd: Form over function.
26:42 - Michael Kianmahd: I just need better visibility.
26:48 - Michael Kianmahd: And it's hard for me to manage expectations internally.
26:54 - Michael Kianmahd: And Laura, you probably hear it on our like calls like when is this
going to be done?
26:57 - Michael Kianmahd: Like, why is this not that kind of thing?
27:01 - Michael Kianmahd: So it just it's hard for me to tell right now.
27:10 - Cory Gambello: Yeah, and I know that one was in the court so I can follow up with
him.
27:13 - Cory Gambello: I'll be with him next week as well.
27:15 - Cory Gambello: So make sure we're pushing that forward and sharing updates with
you as we go.
27:20 - Michael Kianmahd: Amazing.
27:23 - Cory Gambello: Awesome.
27:24 - Cory Gambello: Michael, anything else while I'm on here that you wanted to cover?
27:27 - Cory Gambello: Any concerns, questions, anything like that?
27:30 - Michael Kianmahd: I'm good guys.
27:31 - Michael Kianmahd: Thank you.
27:33 - Cory Gambello: We'll make sure we have all the details to share with you.
27:35 - Cory Gambello: Readjust the meeting as needed here and then I'll touch base with
Dave on the reporting side.
27:41 - Michael Kianmahd: Okay.
27:42 - Michael Kianmahd: Thank you guys.
27:43 - Michael Kianmahd: Thank you.
27:43 - Michael Kianmahd: Thank you, Michael.
27:45 - Michael Kianmahd: See you soon.
