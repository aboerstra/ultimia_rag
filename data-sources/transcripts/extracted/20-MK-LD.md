Maxim Roadmap Transcript
00:02 - Laura Dolphin: Oh, whoops.
00:08 - Adrian Boerstra: Thanks, Spiky.
00:11 - Laura Dolphin: All right, I'll just say that one more time.
00:12 - Laura Dolphin: So, on our last call, I showed you in the sandbox the data model that
you want to get to.
00:22 - Laura Dolphin: So, this here is the Epic in Jira with all of the relevant work items that
need to...
00:27 - Adrian Boerstra: Are you showing your...
00:29 - Adrian Boerstra: Oh, there we go.
00:30 - Laura Dolphin: yeah, that need to be done in order to like get there.
00:33 - Laura Dolphin: This is like one of the main goals, or at least it's like the phase zero,
phase one to pave the road in order to achieve some of their goals.
00:46 - Laura Dolphin: So I think I feel like he wants to see just that presented on like almost
like a calendar type
00:54 - Laura Dolphin: view similar to what you were showing for like the joint where even if
it's high level I can show I
01:01 - Laura Dolphin: can like pull this out and give you the estimates they're definitely not
40 hours it's a lot like
01:07 - Laura Dolphin: more than that but um like I feel like this is what he wants to see
almost like phase zero
01:14 - Laura Dolphin: get your data model implemented gonna be 200 hours or whatever
it is and then we have like a calendar
01:23 - Laura Dolphin: We put July or August or whatever it is, and then it's like phase two.
01:28 - Laura Dolphin: And then we put the goals.
01:32 - Laura Dolphin: Or we put those other milestones, like enotary.
01:36 - Laura Dolphin: Like, I think that's all he really wants to see.
01:38 - Laura Dolphin: He doesn't necessarily need a whole bunch of like worded details
around it.
01:44 - Laura Dolphin: I think he just wants to see like, in the, like that previous roadmap that
we had done.
01:50 - Laura Dolphin: He just wants that updated, I believe.
01:54 - Laura Dolphin: Like this guy.
01:57 - Laura Dolphin: Now I'm all for.
02:00 - Adrian Boerstra: No, I'm not suggesting.
02:01 - Adrian Boerstra: I was just showing you what I don't.
02:04 - Adrian Boerstra: I was really showing you what it was giving me.
02:08 - Adrian Boerstra: It was I wasn't proposing that is what we we put in front of them.
02:13 - Adrian Boerstra: And I share your observations.
02:16 - Adrian Boerstra: I was a little bit frustrated that going through that.
02:21 - Adrian Boerstra: Going through that process that I haven't got more, that's action-
able.
02:28 - Laura Dolphin: Well, to be fair, I don't know.
02:31 - Laura Dolphin: Maybe we just didn't prompt it to actually give relevant Salesforce
related tasks.
02:38 - Laura Dolphin: Maybe it was approached a little bit too.
02:40 - Laura Dolphin: I don't know what you prompted it, but what Michael wants to see is,
He wants to see the actual work items in Salesforce.
02:50 - Laura Dolphin: I don't know if we've prompted that.
02:51 - Laura Dolphin: I feel like we went a little bit too high-level executive, what are your
business goals, which are great.
02:57 - Laura Dolphin: It would probably be relevant for us to show and have that discussion.
03:03 - Laura Dolphin: But either which way, I don't know how to, I just need to give him, this
is how much money I need.
03:12 - Laura Dolphin: I just need help creating something that's going to show that to him
with those milestones.
03:20 - Adrian Boerstra: Let me just go into Jira here.
03:25 - Laura Dolphin: Now I just have the data model one built out.
03:27 - Laura Dolphin: I didn't build much else because I didn't know.
03:31 - Laura Dolphin: But I mean, at least like at a minimum, if we just show him this today,
I feel like maybe he'll get a good like this is this is probably the next like two months, two,
three months of work, right?
03:44 - Laura Dolphin: So I feel like you just show him this or even like a month, depending
on how much he wants to spend, right?
03:50 - Adrian Boerstra: So we can just show him this and like, under I do think I do think we
need to go a year out, though.
03:56 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah, that's fine.
03:56 - Laura Dolphin: But I mean, what I'm trying to get is he's trying to like budget, but I,
this is like, I haven't gone as far as that.
04:05 - Laura Dolphin: So this is like two months, right.
04:08 - Laura Dolphin: And I can show him like, okay, these are the estimates on all the tasks.
04:11 - Laura Dolphin: So in that two months, it's going to take approximately X amount of
hours, X amount of dollars.
04:16 - Laura Dolphin: Right.
04:16 - Laura Dolphin: And then we can just add a higher level than almost like do that
roadmap for those other activities and just do like a guess at like a ballpark.
04:24 - Laura Dolphin: Right.
04:24 - Adrian Boerstra: I think what I'd like to do is, do you agree with what I had up there,
though, is what the, you know, what they're referring to as value streams?
04:34 - Adrian Boerstra: I'm thinking the value streams are essentially swim lanes, and then
we do have initiatives or projects across each value stream.
04:43 - Laura Dolphin: What were your value streams?
04:46 - Laura Dolphin: Sorry, it was a little bit hard to.
04:48 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah, let me pull that up again.
04:49 - Laura Dolphin: Thank you.
05:01 - Laura Dolphin: Oh yeah, okay, yeah, so application intake, yes.
05:04 - Laura Dolphin: Credit, yes.
05:07 - Laura Dolphin: Documentation, I don't know about contracting, but documentation,
yeah.
05:11 - Laura Dolphin: Funding, yeah.
05:14 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
05:15 - Laura Dolphin: Broker relation, yes.
05:21 - Laura Dolphin: Is product and program innovation like kind of like marketing and
building new like sales streams and stuff like real estate versus, is that what that is?
05:32 - Adrian Boerstra: Well, I guess I could answer your question, but then I'd be guessing
as well.
05:37 - Adrian Boerstra: So let me just ask what it had, like product Roi and innovation
velocity.
05:43 - Adrian Boerstra: So this is like, this is actually managing the tool as a product.
05:49 - Adrian Boerstra: So thinking about, hey, are we moving forward?
05:54 - Adrian Boerstra: So the product itself is what we're implementing.
05:58 - Adrian Boerstra: It's not their product.
06:00 - Adrian Boerstra: It's actually like the Salesforce, basically, as a product.
06:05 - Laura Dolphin: Oh, Ok.
06:06 - Laura Dolphin: So then I don't know if that is.
06:09 - Adrian Boerstra: Well, so I'm going to defend that one, because this is like the
governance for that as a product and saying, being able to go, hey, is this delivering value?
06:21 - Adrian Boerstra: Because otherwise.
06:22 - Laura Dolphin: Oh, Ok.
06:24 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah, because otherwise there's nobody specifically looking at
measuring, like when we put something in place to go around portfolio management or if we
wanted to implement Kpis or anything like that for the system so that we are on an ongoing
basis saying, hey, how's the product doing?
06:45 - Adrian Boerstra: How are people doing?
06:46 - Adrian Boerstra: That in and of itself is a value stream.
06:49 - Laura Dolphin: Okay.
06:51 - Adrian Boerstra: How did I just get over to?
07:06 - Adrian Boerstra: So I do.
07:11 - Adrian Boerstra: There it is.
07:13 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah.
07:14 - Adrian Boerstra: So basically, this is all within the business, and this is sort of like on
top of the business.
07:19 - Adrian Boerstra: But the idea is we want them to be looking at this as an ongoing
continuous improvement.
07:25 - Adrian Boerstra: You're managing a product for your team and continually improving
it and making sure it's better.
07:31 - Adrian Boerstra: And so this is the product oversight.
07:39 - Adrian Boerstra: And then everything else is like core lines of business.
07:43 - Adrian Boerstra: Well, not really lines of business, but you know what I mean.
07:49 - Adrian Boerstra: Okay, so I'd like to organize things along these lines to show.
07:55 - Adrian Boerstra: Here's what we're doing on the along each of these things.
07:58 - Laura Dolphin: Okay.
07:58 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
07:58 - Laura Dolphin: So I, you've got like, some of the metrics and stuff are incorrect and
the namings and stuff, but I, let's talk it, let's talk it through.
08:08 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
08:08 - Laura Dolphin: Do you, do you have any way that you can just like update, do you
have like a format where you can just update it real time?
08:13 - Laura Dolphin: Um, put it in Excel and then we can update it.
08:16 - Adrian Boerstra: Sure.
08:59 - Adrian Boerstra: I'm just going to share this with you as well.
09:09 - Laura Dolphin: Okay, so.
09:33 - Laura Dolphin: Oh, can you make it not read only for me.
09:37 - Adrian Boerstra: Please I'll have to get authorization.
09:45 - Laura Dolphin: Cheeky.
09:50 - Adrian Boerstra: There you go.
09:51 - Adrian Boerstra: You're all powerful.
09:52 - Laura Dolphin: Thank you.
09:53 - Laura Dolphin: All right.
09:59 - Laura Dolphin: So application intake.
10:07 - Adrian Boerstra: Let's just create a new column beside it of our thoughts around it.
10:13 - Laura Dolphin: Okay.
10:14 - Laura Dolphin: So I would put like...
10:18 - Adrian Boerstra: Because I do think about application intake as being like lead
conversion as well, because when they get an application that is essentially a lead.
10:28 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah, the only thing is they only use leads for like some, so really it's
a time...
10:33 - Adrian Boerstra: matter whether we're talking about the using leads in Salesforce.
10:39 - Adrian Boerstra: From a business perspective, that's a lead.
10:48 - Adrian Boerstra: But we like, so we can define it, what it means in the context of
Salesforce
10:58 - Laura Dolphin: I'm going to put like time.
11:03 - Laura Dolphin: I do not like Sharepoint, or whatever this is.
11:11 - Laura Dolphin: How do you, you can do open and that's okay.
11:16 - Adrian Boerstra: Open in desktop.
11:19 - Laura Dolphin: Slash time opportunity.
11:22 - Laura Dolphin: Great.
11:22 - Laura Dolphin: I'll just put my thoughts here.
11:29 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah, that's fine.
11:31 - Laura Dolphin: Time decision, that's good.
11:33 - Laura Dolphin: Documentation.
11:38 - Laura Dolphin: Hang on, I need to find that doc that I gave you around.
11:53 - Laura Dolphin: Oh, I don't like doing this stuff at all.
11:55 - Laura Dolphin: Okay.
12:18 - Laura Dolphin: Okay, so long story short, we don't have a road map.
12:20 - Laura Dolphin: We're probably not going to have one by the call.
12:22 - Adrian Boerstra: No, we will.
12:23 - Adrian Boerstra: It's tomorrow, right?
12:25 - Laura Dolphin: It's in an hour and a half.
12:28 - Adrian Boerstra: I thought it was tomorrow.
12:30 - Laura Dolphin: No, it's today.
12:31 - Laura Dolphin: I'm off to Nashville tomorrow.
12:32 - Laura Dolphin: It's in an hour and a half, hence why I wanted to do this yesterday.
12:35 - Adrian Boerstra: Oh, why was Dave saying tomorrow?
12:38 - Laura Dolphin: Well, he poked us last night.
12:41 - Laura Dolphin: That message came last night.
12:43 - Adrian Boerstra: Oh, that came in last night?
12:44 - Laura Dolphin: It's at...
12:45 - Adrian Boerstra: Oh.
12:46 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah, yeah, okay, hang on.
12:51 - Adrian Boerstra: We'll have a roadmap.
12:55 - Adrian Boerstra: So.
12:59 - Laura Dolphin: Maximum business goals.
13:00 - Laura Dolphin: Okay, so they want two hours.
13:07 - Adrian Boerstra: So let's not get into this level of detail here for right now then.
13:11 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah, okay.
13:12 - Adrian Boerstra: Overall, we're Ok.
13:13 - Adrian Boerstra: These are the value streams.
13:15 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
13:18 - Adrian Boerstra: Like if there's a major issue with this or we're referring to anything
completely wrong.
13:24 - Laura Dolphin: No, we're good.
13:26 - Adrian Boerstra: So in terms of formatting for the roadmap, we've got we identify
these.
13:33 - Adrian Boerstra: And then basically, we can have across the top the months of the
year, right?
13:43 - Adrian Boerstra: So we'll go.
14:00 - Adrian Boerstra: I'm going to format this prettier.
14:02 - Adrian Boerstra: This is just so we're on the same page.
14:04 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah, that's right.
15:00 - Adrian Boerstra: And then, so application intake, what are the things that we're going
to do over the next 12 months around the application intake.
15:07 - Laura Dolphin: What you're working on, the automated?
15:11 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah.
15:12 - Laura Dolphin: It's the main one.
15:13 - Adrian Boerstra: Ai.
15:15 - Adrian Boerstra: I'm just going to call it Ai-based application intake.
15:19 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
15:20 - Laura Dolphin: And then really just like the Penske.
15:25 - Laura Dolphin: You know, the one from Penske.
15:26 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah.
15:28 - Adrian Boerstra: Penske Partner.
15:30 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
15:31 - Laura Dolphin: Partner.
15:32 - Laura Dolphin: Automated application intake.
15:34 - Laura Dolphin: Like, direct or something like that.
15:37 - Laura Dolphin: Those are the only real ones that we need.
15:42 - Laura Dolphin: And I would probably put time tracking.
15:44 - Laura Dolphin: They don't really have any measure, like, we actually need to in order
to measure things, you actually have to track times.
15:49 - Laura Dolphin: So I would probably just put something around, like, implementation
of time tracking.
16:05 - Laura Dolphin: You can just delete the time received from, but.
16:13 - Laura Dolphin: Oh, you're 1 column down.
16:17 - Laura Dolphin: You're in, like, the title column.
16:21 - Laura Dolphin: Move move those 1 row down.
16:24 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah, yeah.
16:28 - Laura Dolphin: Yes.
16:32 - Adrian Boerstra: Okay, Ai based application intake.
16:35 - Adrian Boerstra: We got Penske, what do we have going around credit underwriting?
16:43 - Laura Dolphin: So, the only thing that we really need to implement there is time
tracking.
16:48 - Laura Dolphin: Can you put the time tracking thing in July for the lead for the
application intake?
16:53 - Laura Dolphin: Sure.
16:55 - Adrian Boerstra: And this is time tracking for?
16:57 - Laura Dolphin: Well, so in order to actually know how well you're doing, you actually
need to stamp certain things, right?
17:02 - Laura Dolphin: Like, when was the application received versus like when was it?
17:06 - Adrian Boerstra: So we're going to do application.
17:08 - Adrian Boerstra: This is application time tracking.
17:11 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
17:13 - Adrian Boerstra: Ok.
17:13 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah, perfect.
17:14 - Laura Dolphin: Credit underwriting, kind of the same thing, is literally just like time
tracking.
17:19 - Laura Dolphin: And then we just need to, I don't know how to say this, but introduce
ownership.
17:33 - Laura Dolphin: So it's really like record owners and time tracking for Sla tracking.
17:40 - Adrian Boerstra: Record owners.
17:41 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
17:44 - Laura Dolphin: You're in the wrong row again.
17:49 - Laura Dolphin: You're in the documentation.
17:51 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
17:51 - Adrian Boerstra: Oh, you're set.
17:52 - Laura Dolphin: You're set for the credit.
17:53 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
17:54 - Adrian Boerstra: Okay.
17:55 - Adrian Boerstra: We'll move it in months after.
17:57 - Laura Dolphin: Okay.
17:59 - Laura Dolphin: Um.
18:06 - Adrian Boerstra: Documentation is going to be like, yeah.
18:09 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
18:16 - Laura Dolphin: Same thing, it's just like time tracking.
18:22 - Laura Dolphin: But I don't know.
18:25 - Laura Dolphin: So the data model is the big one.
18:27 - Laura Dolphin: That's really June.
18:28 - Laura Dolphin: I don't know how it goes across all of them.
18:31 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah, let's put that into the product category.
18:34 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah, perfect.
18:35 - Laura Dolphin: So like new data model.
18:46 - Laura Dolphin: So the documentation, so in row five, in addition to Aio, you've got like
your updated like Conga solutions, not funding in your documentation, yeah.
18:58 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah, here.
19:01 - Laura Dolphin: That's part of the data model stuff, they go together.
19:05 - Adrian Boerstra: Okay
19:07 - Laura Dolphin: I'd put a in July because I was done technically.
19:11 - Laura Dolphin: It's more just like enhancements, but you could maybe actually stretch
enhancements from June through to like.
19:19 - Laura Dolphin: August, because it's probably yeah.
19:21 - Adrian Boerstra: So, I'm putting it in the month that it's being worked on.
19:24 - Laura Dolphin: It'll be worked on in June.
19:25 - Laura Dolphin: There's no chance that they won't have anything any items related to.
19:31 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
19:32 - Laura Dolphin: We built that integration and it's garbage.
19:36 - Adrian Boerstra: So we're good like this.
19:37 - Laura Dolphin: Yep.
19:38 - Adrian Boerstra: Did you say and it's garbage?
19:40 - Laura Dolphin: It's pretty garbage.
19:41 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah, you should see the actual code that was built because it was
all built by Lucas and Hassan who haven't ever worked in Salesforce.
19:48 - Laura Dolphin: So it's literally got comments that are like, this is bad, we need to fix
this later.
19:53 - Laura Dolphin: It works, deploy it, perfect.
19:58 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
19:59 - Laura Dolphin: I mean, it works, it's fine.
20:00 - Laura Dolphin: It's just not a clean up.
20:01 - Adrian Boerstra: We should clean that up though.
20:03 - Laura Dolphin: Uh-huh.
20:06 - Laura Dolphin: I mean, I didn't have any help really.
20:08 - Adrian Boerstra: And then it was a matter of like, We can use Ai to just clean that up
without changing the code.
20:14 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
20:15 - Adrian Boerstra: Clean up the comments.
20:17 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah, but I mean they'll need enhancements.
20:19 - Laura Dolphin: So my plan is that I'll get my proper engineer in there.
20:22 - Laura Dolphin: He's already seen one and like when he went to deploy he was like
this doesn't look right.
20:27 - Laura Dolphin: So I'll just have him clean it up as he goes.
20:30 - Adrian Boerstra: Okay.
20:31 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah, because he'll need to enhance it.
20:33 - Laura Dolphin: Anyways, okay, funding.
20:34 - Laura Dolphin: So, scoring.
20:48 - Laura Dolphin: So the credit underwriting.
20:51 - Laura Dolphin: Can you go back up to in June.
20:55 - Laura Dolphin: That's where this like the scoring enhancements for industry fits.
21:01 - Adrian Boerstra: I'm going to put it in a different month, because I'm going to line up
the months.
21:07 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
21:08 - Adrian Boerstra: Ok.
21:08 - Laura Dolphin: That's fine.
21:09 - Laura Dolphin: You do you.
21:10 - Laura Dolphin: But that one is the scoring-related stuff.
21:23 - Laura Dolphin: E-notaries fits in with, hang on, within 24 hours from approval terms
out to funded.
21:30 - Adrian Boerstra: So hang on, that was?
21:33 - Laura Dolphin: That's documentation.
21:35 - Laura Dolphin: Or sorry, sorry.
21:36 - Laura Dolphin: We missed a couple.
21:38 - Laura Dolphin: So yeah, scoring, just put scoring enhancements for industry, for
industries.
21:44 - Laura Dolphin: Or just scoring enhancements is fine.
21:50 - Laura Dolphin: Perfect.
21:51 - Laura Dolphin: And then in the documentation, yeah, so that one is Conga Solutions.
21:58 - Adrian Boerstra: Oh.
21:58 - Laura Dolphin: June thing.
22:00 - Adrian Boerstra: Okay, I put Conga down into the product thing you had said.
22:05 - Adrian Boerstra: Okay.
22:06 - Laura Dolphin: Okay.
22:08 - Laura Dolphin: Okay, so enotary.
22:10 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
22:12 - Laura Dolphin: That is in the, I think it's in the funding stage.
22:21 - Laura Dolphin: Yes, sure.
22:24 - Laura Dolphin: That's not a June thing.
22:27 - Laura Dolphin: That's like July or August, probably August.
22:31 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah, this is actually August here.
22:33 - Laura Dolphin: Ok.
22:41 - Laura Dolphin: Where were those milestones that I gave you?
22:43 - Laura Dolphin: Hang on.
22:44 - Laura Dolphin: Oh, I've got them written down here.
22:45 - Adrian Boerstra: The goals.
22:47 - Laura Dolphin: funding, one-click sign, approval processes, oh, approval processes
for credit.
22:52 - Laura Dolphin: So credit is credit underwriting.
22:56 - Laura Dolphin: You can probably just put that in like September, maybe.
23:01 - Adrian Boerstra: Right.
23:02 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah, like automated approval processes.
23:04 - Laura Dolphin: One down.
23:05 - Laura Dolphin: Nope, one down.
23:06 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah.
23:14 - Laura Dolphin: And then the boxes, I've got another one that kind of fits across
everything.
23:21 - Laura Dolphin: So they're box automated document storing storage.
23:31 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
23:32 - Laura Dolphin: Automations, yeah.
23:39 - Laura Dolphin: Can you change Conga solutions to Conga and Docusign solutions?
23:44 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
23:44 - Laura Dolphin: Those kind of go together.
23:45 - Laura Dolphin: Thanks.
23:46 - Laura Dolphin: What else do we have?
23:50 - Laura Dolphin: I mean, data model has a lot of subtasks.
23:53 - Laura Dolphin: I don't know if that's relevant.
23:54 - Laura Dolphin: I would just.
23:55 - Adrian Boerstra: It's Ok.
23:56 - Adrian Boerstra: We'll break it out separate.
24:06 - Laura Dolphin: So what else are you looking for here?
24:07 - Adrian Boerstra: You want like items that have been like, like how high level how
detailed well, high level gives me like what I can I can fill in stuff if I have us aligned on what
it actually looks like at this level.
24:24 - Adrian Boerstra: So like it because you know, each one of these things will get broken
down into individual projects and tasks and everything, but like, okay, so let's go ahead.
24:36 - Laura Dolphin: So Aio change that to like Aio, like, it's almost like we're enhancing the
credit like funding.
24:44 - Laura Dolphin: Like, well, sorry, it's called funding checklist, but it's the documenta-
tion.
24:47 - Laura Dolphin: So like, we're, we're enhancing that one.
24:50 - Laura Dolphin: But there's another phase for Aio for like, the broker application
process that I would literally push out to like September or October.
25:00 - Laura Dolphin: No, no, no.
25:01 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah, I know.
25:02 - Adrian Boerstra: I know.
25:02 - Adrian Boerstra: I'm gonna.
25:03 - Laura Dolphin: Okay.
25:10 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
25:11 - Laura Dolphin: And that's, that'll fit in row eight.
25:14 - Adrian Boerstra: I just want to, what is this?
25:17 - Adrian Boerstra: This is Ai.
25:19 - Laura Dolphin: It's like enhance, yeah, phase one enhancements or phase two,
whatever you want to call it.
25:24 - Laura Dolphin: I wouldn't call it phase one because phase one is done.
25:26 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah, exactly.
25:31 - Laura Dolphin: And then that broker application process should be in the row eight.
25:36 - Laura Dolphin: For the broker-dealer relationship management.
25:40 - Adrian Boerstra: This one.
25:41 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
25:42 - Laura Dolphin: I forgot that I have access to like, just go.
25:44 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah, you can move stuff.
25:45 - Laura Dolphin: Sorry.
25:46 - Laura Dolphin: I mean, like just bossy.
25:48 - Adrian Boerstra: I gave you those edit privileges for.
25:53 - Laura Dolphin: Now we're both doing it.
25:54 - Laura Dolphin: There we go.
25:58 - Laura Dolphin: So, okay, so then there's eight by eight.
26:01 - Adrian Boerstra: You're sitting there going, I wish I could just control the.
26:03 - Laura Dolphin: I actually was.
26:06 - Laura Dolphin: how to like.
26:07 - Adrian Boerstra: Oh, I hate telling people what, where to click, it's the worst.
26:11 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah, 8x8, I just literally chucked it in there.
26:15 - Laura Dolphin: I don't know where that sits.
26:17 - Laura Dolphin: It's like their little phone integration.
26:19 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah.
26:21 - Adrian Boerstra: I mean, this is where we kind of have to look at these things and go,
well, which metrics are helped by this?
26:34 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
26:35 - Adrian Boerstra: Is this all about converting leads faster?
26:37 - Adrian Boerstra: Is it about time to decision?
26:42 - Laura Dolphin: Like
26:50 - Adrian Boerstra: putting everything into value streams has you kind of go, Ok, well,
what's the why?
26:56 - Adrian Boerstra: Whose metric is this helping?
26:58 - Laura Dolphin: Mm-hmm.
27:03 - Adrian Boerstra: Which I don't know what the 8 by 8, if any, is it lead conversion time?
27:09 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
27:12 - Laura Dolphin: No, lead conversion time is not.
27:14 - Laura Dolphin: I mean, I wouldn't use that word.
27:16 - Laura Dolphin: Michael will get stuck on it.
27:19 - Laura Dolphin: You got to, I know him.
27:21 - Adrian Boerstra: I'll just go application.
27:21 - Laura Dolphin: He literally will get stuck on a word and just go off of it for an hour.
27:26 - Adrian Boerstra: Let's just go new application conversion time.
27:28 - Laura Dolphin: Perfect, yeah.
27:35 - Laura Dolphin: I don't really know.
27:38 - Laura Dolphin: Oh, sales tax.
27:41 - Adrian Boerstra: It is interesting when you put it in like, Ok, phone integration.
27:44 - Adrian Boerstra: It's an integration.
27:45 - Adrian Boerstra: What is that changing?
27:48 - Adrian Boerstra: Where do you move the mark?
27:49 - Adrian Boerstra: I don't know.
27:51 - Adrian Boerstra: How does that become a priority for us even?
27:54 - Laura Dolphin: I don't know where any of these things fit because they just fit in like
sales tax credit underwriting.
28:03 - Laura Dolphin: Sure.
28:11 - Laura Dolphin: I'm trying to think like I have a lot of like little requests on here, like a
lot of tasks.
28:16 - Laura Dolphin: But there's nothing that's like almost worth it.
28:20 - Laura Dolphin: I don't want to go too detailed because then it's like then you could
just put everything in there.
28:28 - Adrian Boerstra: You can see it does start to, if you end up having a bunch of things
that, oh, I just put this in general, if it's all general, like these are the, those metrics in column
C are the things we're trying to achieve.
28:40 - Adrian Boerstra: If something doesn't clearly move forward on any of those metrics,
you have to ask, is it worth doing?
28:47 - Laura Dolphin: Okay.
28:52 - Adrian Boerstra: Okay, um, in the data model refresh.
28:55 - Adrian Boerstra: Absolutely.
28:56 - Adrian Boerstra: That's just foundation will be able to get to get and duplicate.
29:05 - Laura Dolphin: I don't know if that fits there but like we're getting and I'm going to
get them a new duplicate tool, because their data is just terrible.
29:13 - Laura Dolphin: What else?
29:19 - Laura Dolphin: That's I can't think of anything else.
29:21 - Adrian Boerstra: That's like one of the things that our experts did say was obviously
like, make sure you get your, don't automate garbage, make sure you know what you're doing,
clean up the process, and then automated don't digitize madness.
29:38 - Laura Dolphin: Uh, I mean, I put this on every roadmap and every conversation I've
ever had with Michael, I need to spend like a lot of time cleaning the org up and he just does
not want to like make it a priority.
29:47 - Laura Dolphin: So then when I told him is that I'll just like, every time I come across
anything, I have to spend an additional.
29:54 - Laura Dolphin: Double, if not more time cleaning it up so that I can like fix stuff or
change it in terms of like their process and stuff.
30:02 - Laura Dolphin: Nope.
30:02 - Laura Dolphin: Their system, just like, Oh, you're talking.
30:04 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah.
30:04 - Laura Dolphin: In terms of the system, the data model refreshes really their process.
30:08 - Laura Dolphin: like laying over their actual process with the structure of that.
30:12 - Laura Dolphin: Um, this is more just like their org is a hot mess, you know, Salesforce,
you can't like in order to like put new things in and make changes, you can't do it unless you
clean stuff up.
30:23 - Laura Dolphin: They've got so much garbage in there.
30:25 - Laura Dolphin: They had 10 years of people using production as a sandbox.
30:28 - Laura Dolphin: Let me put it that way.
30:32 - Adrian Boerstra: If we look at the application time tracking
30:37 - Adrian Boerstra: this is going to apply all the way through.
30:41 - Adrian Boerstra: Is this one project or are we breaking this up into for application
intake, let's do time tracking up to a certain point?
30:50 - Laura Dolphin: It's not even really a project.
30:53 - Laura Dolphin: It's literally just identifying when we want to track.
30:57 - Laura Dolphin: It's as simple as putting in a little field or a flow or something that just
captured that, so that you can almost like measure it in a report, right?
31:05 - Laura Dolphin: If we need to be able to say it now, like it takes X amount of time after
this or whatever to like process an application.
31:15 - Laura Dolphin: We don't have those metrics in place, right?
31:18 - Laura Dolphin: So it's really just implementing that so that we can track these things
and we can say like, so to be honest, those really- I'm just saying when you tackle it, are you
just gonna tackle it across the board as a single?
31:29 - Laura Dolphin: No, they would be done separately, because the data model will like
31:35 - Laura Dolphin: each of the other projects will affect how we track the time.
31:40 - Laura Dolphin: Let's put it that way.
31:45 - Adrian Boerstra: But at some point, there will be, I mean, it does sound more and
more like it is a project.
31:50 - Laura Dolphin: Like it'll be a project.
31:51 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah, it could be.
31:52 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah, you do get afterplans.
31:54 - Adrian Boerstra: It'll be a project of deciding what we're going to track.
31:56 - Laura Dolphin: Yes.
31:57 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
31:57 - Adrian Boerstra: How to capture it.
31:59 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
31:59 - Adrian Boerstra: How to report on it.
32:00 - Laura Dolphin: Yes.
32:02 - Adrian Boerstra: So I'm going to put that across.
32:05 - Laura Dolphin: Ok.
32:06 - Laura Dolphin: That works.
32:07 - Adrian Boerstra: And you may not do them all in the same month, but it seems like.
32:14 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
32:16 - Laura Dolphin: And then that's, yeah, I guess that's it.
32:23 - Laura Dolphin: I mean, there's a lot of stuff that we had in that roadmap, but honestly,
I don't, I haven't heard much about any of those other things.
32:31 - Adrian Boerstra: So are you talking about in our Powerpoint and our previous, yeah.
32:34 - Laura Dolphin: And like the original one, there were just so many like integration
points that were like laid out there.
32:41 - Laura Dolphin: Um, I wouldn't worry about any of that.
32:44 - Adrian Boerstra: So let's call it, I feel like if we even just have a structure to put in front
of him so that he sees things in this sort of a way, things come up, we can just basically plot
it out and go, Ok, let's evaluate across their value streams.
33:02 - Adrian Boerstra: And let's plan out when we're going to be doing what.
33:05 - Adrian Boerstra: Even if it's going to change, and it will definitely change throughout
the year, at least we have one thing that we open up and work on it from.
33:16 - Adrian Boerstra: I think it's already moving forward.
33:22 - Laura Dolphin: June is way too packed.
33:24 - Laura Dolphin: So the data model refresh and duplicate management alone is
probably about 200 to 220 hours.
33:31 - Laura Dolphin: Because that includes all the document stuff.
33:34 - Laura Dolphin: It would be worth having, like, almost just the bottom, like, a summary
of the bottom that just says estimate so that he can see.
33:44 - Laura Dolphin: How much time each of these items takes and he can then say, like,
okay, well, that's.
33:49 - Laura Dolphin: He doesn't want to spend.
33:51 - Adrian Boerstra: Well, let's do that.
33:52 - Adrian Boerstra: Now what I can do is I can have Ai generate out tasks and all that
stuff, and I can pull them into Asana pretty quick, put them in multiple projects on that
portfolio view in Asana that I showed you.
34:07 - Adrian Boerstra: I'll just create the Maxim portfolio.
34:11 - Adrian Boerstra: Well, actually, that's not going to organize it into the value streams,
which I like seeing it in that way.
34:16 - Adrian Boerstra: actually what I would do then is each value stream is a project and
then each
34:25 - Adrian Boerstra: task is going to be one of these like these projects become a task
in
34:34 - Adrian Boerstra: Asana and then it'll display projects it'll display our value streams
down the
34:40 - Adrian Boerstra: left-hand side and then it'll put everything into a Gantt chart so I just
34:45 - Adrian Boerstra: would create one task for each project and go
34:47 - Adrian Boerstra: Ok, that's going to span June and July.
34:50 - Adrian Boerstra: You know what I mean?
34:51 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah, Ok.
34:52 - Adrian Boerstra: One level higher, projects become tasks in that world.
35:00 - Laura Dolphin: Ok.
35:00 - Laura Dolphin: I actually think that record owner's one is probably not relevant.
35:04 - Laura Dolphin: That couldn't fit in with the time tracking.
35:06 - Laura Dolphin: So time tracking and ownership would be.
35:09 - Laura Dolphin: Can I take that out?
35:10 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah, yeah, do whatever you want.
35:13 - Adrian Boerstra: In fact, why don't you just take a quiet moment to yourself.
35:16 - Adrian Boerstra: Are we at 10.30 or 11.30?
35:19 - Laura Dolphin: Oh, a meeting's in an hour from now.
35:21 - Adrian Boerstra: In an hour.
35:22 - Adrian Boerstra: Okay, cool.
35:24 - Laura Dolphin: Here, I'll just do like this, like that.
35:28 - Adrian Boerstra: Okay, yeah, just take a moment, go through this.
35:31 - Adrian Boerstra: I'm going to just get prepared to bring this into a visual, okay?
36:09 - Adrian Boerstra: Are you comfortable with what we've got here right now?
36:12 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
36:15 - Laura Dolphin: Sure.
36:23 - Adrian Boerstra: I'll play your little game.
36:24 - Laura Dolphin: I just like it's hard like where I struggle is because these are very
36:30 - Laura Dolphin: high level and for me the detail like the devil's always in the details
and
36:34 - Laura Dolphin: like I have a hundred and whatever tasks in Jira that are like things
that people
36:39 - Laura Dolphin: have asked for or need to be done yeah like they don't even some of
them don't
36:43 - Laura Dolphin: even fit into these categories but I just don't know because they're
just
36:47 - Laura Dolphin: like a little kind of things that are needed right and that like yeah so
I'm
36:53 - Laura Dolphin: just but this is fine this is enough for like I think what he probably
wants to see.
42:31 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah.
42:36 - Adrian Boerstra: to be in meetings for a bit.
54:47 - Adrian Boerstra: You still there?
54:49 - Laura Dolphin: Yep.
54:50 - Adrian Boerstra: Can you do me a favor?
54:51 - Adrian Boerstra: I just shared out, I'm sharing out the portfolio with you.
54:55 - Adrian Boerstra: I just want to actually create the, I was going to do an import, but we
don't have that much information and I don't, and so getting to an Ai generated Csv, that's
going to have other issues.
55:06 - Laura Dolphin: Okay.
55:07 - Adrian Boerstra: It takes more time than it saves us.
55:10 - Adrian Boerstra: So I'm, I've invited you to the portfolio.
55:15 - Laura Dolphin: Okay.
55:17 - Laura Dolphin: Where are you inviting me on the Zoom?
55:20 - Adrian Boerstra: You know, in your email, probably.
55:22 - Laura Dolphin: Ok.
55:23 - Adrian Boerstra: Here, I'll add it into the Zoom.
55:26 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah, it just hasn't come yet.
55:27 - Laura Dolphin: I'll give it a minute.
55:29 - Laura Dolphin: Oh, there it is.
55:29 - Laura Dolphin: I got it.
55:32 - Laura Dolphin: To the Asana, you mean?
55:33 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah, let's go into Asana.
55:36 - Adrian Boerstra: Ok, I'm just creating a project for each value stream.
55:41 - Laura Dolphin: Ok.
55:42 - Adrian Boerstra: And then we'll just create tasks for the projects.
55:44 - Adrian Boerstra: So we don't have to define all the tasks on every project, but this
will give us one overall visual timeline looking across value streams and projects.
55:56 - Laura Dolphin: Ok, sorry.
55:57 - Laura Dolphin: So what do you need from me?
55:59 - Laura Dolphin: What do you want me to do?
56:00 - Adrian Boerstra: Add in the tasks that we have in our spreadsheet.
56:03 - Laura Dolphin: Oh, yeah.
56:04 - Laura Dolphin: Do you want me to do all of them?
56:07 - Adrian Boerstra: Just you start at the top.
56:09 - Adrian Boerstra: I'll start at the bottom.
56:10 - Adrian Boerstra: I'm creating the projects.
56:13 - Adrian Boerstra: I'm creating the value streams as projects.
56:15 - Laura Dolphin: Do I need to put anything like due dates or anything or no?
56:19 - Adrian Boerstra: No, just for the project.
56:22 - Adrian Boerstra: Each task will be a project with a start and an end date.
56:25 - Adrian Boerstra: So I'm creating a sauna project for the value stream.
56:31 - Adrian Boerstra: You're creating a task in that project for the project.
56:35 - Laura Dolphin: Ok, cool.
56:36 - Adrian Boerstra: Does that make sense?
56:37 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
56:39 - Adrian Boerstra: The whole thing is one level higher than it normally would be.
56:46 - Laura Dolphin: Ok, application intake is done.
56:54 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah, so I created an application.
56:55 - Adrian Boerstra: Ok, there you go.
56:57 - Adrian Boerstra: Cool.
57:01 - Laura Dolphin: Do you want me to create the projects?
57:02 - Laura Dolphin: I only see application intake.
57:05 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah.
57:05 - Adrian Boerstra: I'm, uh, I just think my, I lost my worksheet.
57:14 - Laura Dolphin: Oh, wait, it's a, is it a project or at work?
57:18 - Laura Dolphin: Where's my, hang on, I'm going to share.
57:24 - Laura Dolphin: I don't think I'm getting what you're asking for here.
57:27 - Laura Dolphin: So this is what I did, and I just literally copy pasted this, and this under
here.
57:34 - Laura Dolphin: Is that what you want?
57:35 - Adrian Boerstra: Let me see your screen.
57:42 - Adrian Boerstra: So for application intake, we should have Ai-based application
intake, ownership time tracking, and Pins.
57:50 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah, that's right.
57:51 - Adrian Boerstra: Ok, so then how do you work?
57:52 - Adrian Boerstra: Just set the dates on it so that when we look at the portfolio view,
it's going to push each of them into the right month.
57:58 - Laura Dolphin: Ok, so June, July, and September.
58:15 - Laura Dolphin: Ok, so then how do you create the, I can create there.
58:18 - Laura Dolphin: This only took a second.
58:19 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
58:19 - Laura Dolphin: Are you creating a project in here?
58:22 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah, I created a credit underwriting as well.
58:27 - Laura Dolphin: Ok, so you all just.
58:29 - Adrian Boerstra: I'm creating the projects.
58:31 - Adrian Boerstra: You have a place to put them.
58:32 - Adrian Boerstra: You just go ahead and create each of the.
58:34 - Laura Dolphin: Ok.
58:38 - Laura Dolphin: Oops.
01:01:11 - Laura Dolphin: I'll leave out the 8x8 phone integration for now, if I'm honest.
01:01:17 - Laura Dolphin: Okay, they're done.
01:01:19 - Adrian Boerstra: They have dates on them?
01:01:21 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
01:01:23 - Adrian Boerstra: Okay.
01:01:25 - Adrian Boerstra: I'm not seeing them on that.
01:01:27 - Adrian Boerstra: Let me just refresh this.
01:01:29 - Laura Dolphin: Oh, I didn't make you the owner.
01:01:31 - Laura Dolphin: Was I supposed to do that?
01:01:33 - Adrian Boerstra: No, I don't need to be the owner.
01:01:37 - Adrian Boerstra: But I'm not seeing...
01:01:44 - Adrian Boerstra: I should be able to see them on the timeline.
01:01:48 - Adrian Boerstra: I see them on the timeline.
01:01:52 - Adrian Boerstra: I think they need, okay, so can you click on the timeline view for
each?
01:01:58 - Adrian Boerstra: Right now they just have a due date.
01:01:59 - Adrian Boerstra: If you stretch that
01:02:02 - Adrian Boerstra: so it takes up a little bit more time.
01:02:07 - Adrian Boerstra: Do you see what I'm saying?
01:02:10 - Adrian Boerstra: Let me see.
01:02:11 - Laura Dolphin: I see it here.
01:02:12 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah, yeah.
01:02:12 - Adrian Boerstra: So click right on the thing and then drag it over the time period
that you think each one of those is going to.
01:02:19 - Laura Dolphin: Oh, Ok.
01:02:19 - Laura Dolphin: So do July 31.
01:02:23 - Laura Dolphin: Hi, hang on.
01:02:24 - Laura Dolphin: I'm orienting.
01:02:25 - Laura Dolphin: Oh, like that?
01:02:26 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah.
01:02:27 - Laura Dolphin: Gotcha.
01:02:27 - Laura Dolphin: Ok.
01:02:28 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah, if you do that, and then you'll see the portfolio.
01:02:35 - Laura Dolphin: Oh, you can add.
01:02:38 - Laura Dolphin: You just add start date in here.
01:02:40 - Laura Dolphin: That's what's missing.
01:02:41 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah, you can add start date.
01:02:42 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah, I find that easier than dragging.
01:02:45 - Laura Dolphin: Ai, let me just drag this here.
01:02:51 - Laura Dolphin: Ai, start May, ownership, start.
01:03:23 - Laura Dolphin: Okay, ownership, we start.
01:04:08 - Laura Dolphin: What is it?
01:04:17 - Laura Dolphin: I mean, I approve process.
01:04:22 - Laura Dolphin: Timber.
01:04:26 - Laura Dolphin: Is this correct what I'm doing?
01:04:29 - Laura Dolphin: Is this what you wanted?
01:04:31 - Adrian Boerstra: Let me look at your screen.
01:04:35 - Laura Dolphin: Oh, I just meant like is it accurately reflecting?
01:04:39 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah, click on the timeline.
01:04:44 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah, I don't know.
01:04:46 - Adrian Boerstra: I'm trying.
01:04:52 - Adrian Boerstra: If you go to just the timeline, go to the project itself, like if you go
to application intake, just check that timeline view.
01:05:05 - Adrian Boerstra: We want them showing that they're happening over time.
01:05:10 - Laura Dolphin: Oh, okay.
01:05:11 - Laura Dolphin: So, the start date does just not reflect or something.
01:05:14 - Laura Dolphin: Okay.
01:05:14 - Laura Dolphin: That's annoying.
01:05:22 - Adrian Boerstra: Oh, did you see the due date?
01:05:28 - Adrian Boerstra: It's got the due date over a period of time when they show up
like that.
01:05:36 - Laura Dolphin: Gotcha.
01:05:37 - Laura Dolphin: That's weird.
01:05:39 - Laura Dolphin: Sure.
01:05:42 - Adrian Boerstra: And I'm trying to get it to show up at the portfolio view properly.
01:05:46 - Laura Dolphin: Okay.
01:05:50 - Laura Dolphin: Okay, so this guy goes like this.
01:05:53 - Laura Dolphin: Hi
01:06:05 - Laura Dolphin: Oh
01:06:36 - Adrian Boerstra: Oh shit.
01:06:42 - Adrian Boerstra: Project tasks are not visible in the portfolio timeline view, but
project milestones do appear.
01:06:59 - Adrian Boerstra: So how does that...
01:07:36 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
01:07:38 - Laura Dolphin: It doesn't look like you can actually show those.
01:07:41 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah.
01:07:42 - Adrian Boerstra: I think, well, there's a.
01:07:54 - Adrian Boerstra: This is.
01:07:56 - Adrian Boerstra: See this?
01:08:12 - Adrian Boerstra: Ok, so it will show your milestones.
01:08:18 - Adrian Boerstra: But this is what I've seen before, where I've had them come up,
and it shows me all of this.
01:08:22 - Adrian Boerstra: but it says it doesn't show tasks.
01:08:26 - Adrian Boerstra: Milestones appear for visual example.
01:08:36 - Adrian Boerstra: Visualize project durations and dependencies.
01:08:52 - Adrian Boerstra: So what has to be...
01:09:19 - Adrian Boerstra: I've got a meeting starting in five minutes.
01:09:22 - Adrian Boerstra: Let me see if I can move that.
01:10:19 - Laura Dolphin: Okay, I think I've done.
01:10:30 - Laura Dolphin: Can
01:10:45 - Adrian Boerstra: you just take a look at that while I'm trying to rearrange my
meeting?
01:10:50 - Adrian Boerstra: I know there is a way that, so I guess it's not tasks that will show
up at the portfolio view, but there is a way to make the whole project's timeline show up.
01:11:02 - Laura Dolphin: Okay, yep.
01:11:13 - Adrian Boerstra: Maybe it's just that we have to add in milestones.
01:11:23 - Laura Dolphin: I'll just have a play.
01:12:45 - Laura Dolphin: Oh, if you go into the workload in the project itself, I think that may
be what you want.
01:12:53 - Adrian Boerstra: I put in, I just put in a milestone and that showed up.
01:12:57 - Adrian Boerstra: Okay, there's actually a due date on the project too.
01:13:00 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah, actually, you know what, that's, these should be, those, what
you put in should be milestones, or what I put in, like application, yeah.
01:13:09 - Adrian Boerstra: That's what I'm kind of thinking too.
01:13:11 - Adrian Boerstra: I got something to show up here.
01:13:16 - Adrian Boerstra: If you go into the project application intake
01:13:22 - Adrian Boerstra: and go to
01:13:25 - Adrian Boerstra: edit project details, I put in...
01:13:30 - Laura Dolphin: Connect to portfolios.
01:13:36 - Adrian Boerstra: So frustrated.
01:13:41 - Adrian Boerstra: How are you so patient with me?
01:13:48 - Laura Dolphin: Do you really want to know?
01:13:56 - Adrian Boerstra: Okay, I think I figured that out.
01:14:09 - Adrian Boerstra: There we go.
01:14:11 - Adrian Boerstra: If you take a look at the portfolio timeline now.
01:14:15 - Laura Dolphin: Okay.
01:14:16 - Laura Dolphin: Yep.
01:14:17 - Adrian Boerstra: See how there's a bar here?
01:14:20 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
01:14:20 - Adrian Boerstra: Location intake.
01:14:22 - Adrian Boerstra: That is, I got to that by going into the project itself.
01:14:28 - Laura Dolphin: Okay.
01:14:30 - Adrian Boerstra: I click in the actions and then edit project details.
01:14:37 - Laura Dolphin: Yep.
01:14:38 - Laura Dolphin: And then the view date.
01:14:39 - Laura Dolphin: View project details.
01:14:41 - Laura Dolphin: I can't do it.
01:14:43 - Laura Dolphin: I'm not a project admin.
01:14:48 - Adrian Boerstra: Let me give you more permissions.
01:14:51 - Adrian Boerstra: Where much is given, much is required, though.
01:14:56 - Laura Dolphin: Is editor or admin?
01:15:00 - Adrian Boerstra: I just need you to credit underwriting.
01:15:03 - Adrian Boerstra: I think I have to go into each one of these now.
01:15:12 - Adrian Boerstra: Okay, you're.
01:15:14 - Laura Dolphin: I need to be a program admin.
01:15:16 - Laura Dolphin: You may be an editor on the other one too.
01:15:18 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah, yeah.
01:15:19 - Adrian Boerstra: Application intake, you're an admin now.
01:15:21 - Laura Dolphin: Ok, so edit
01:15:27 - Laura Dolphin: project details.
01:15:28 - Laura Dolphin: And then what did you do?
01:15:31 - Adrian Boerstra: And then you see the due date?
01:15:33 - Adrian Boerstra: You can drag it over any period of time you want.
01:15:40 - Adrian Boerstra: And then it'll show the bar as soon as you have a due date in
there.
01:15:49 - Laura Dolphin: Oh, you're putting a due date on the project itself?
01:15:51 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah, on the project.
01:15:52 - Laura Dolphin: Ah, okay, sorry.
01:15:59 - Laura Dolphin: Okay.
01:16:02 - Laura Dolphin: Task.
01:16:09 - Laura Dolphin: I don't see a due date.
01:16:11 - Laura Dolphin: Can you show me one more time what you did?
01:16:14 - Laura Dolphin: I just go into this funding and edit it, because I'm not like, I don't.
01:16:17 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah, can you see my screen?
01:16:19 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah, I am, yeah.
01:16:20 - Adrian Boerstra: Okay, so if you go into here, Yeah.
01:16:23 - Adrian Boerstra: Project details.
01:16:25 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
01:16:25 - Adrian Boerstra: Due date, just do this.
01:16:27 - Laura Dolphin: Oh, okay.
01:16:30 - Adrian Boerstra: And then it'll show up, and then you can drag it on the portfolio
view.
01:16:34 - Laura Dolphin: Okay.
01:16:38 - Adrian Boerstra: It actually does not really end up achieving what I wanted,
because I want to be able to have multiple.
01:16:45 - Laura Dolphin: So then you need to actually, that's your milestones.
01:16:49 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah, it's milestones is really what we need.
01:16:52 - Adrian Boerstra: Each milestone should be.
01:16:55 - Adrian Boerstra: Now the nice thing is if we do, we can actually edit the milestone
that looks like right from here.
01:17:00 - Adrian Boerstra: So if we create the milestone objects.
01:17:11 - Adrian Boerstra: Okay, give me one sec.
01:17:21 - Adrian Boerstra: Oh, perfect.
01:17:41 - Adrian Boerstra: He said, yeah, no problem.
01:17:42 - Adrian Boerstra: Let's go in an hour.
01:17:44 - Adrian Boerstra: I have a different meeting.
01:17:45 - Adrian Boerstra: It was a meeting with the giant.
01:17:47 - Adrian Boerstra: That lets me breathe a little bit.
01:17:52 - Adrian Boerstra: Okay, application intake.
01:17:58 - Adrian Boerstra: So, and a project detail.
01:18:03 - Adrian Boerstra: Oh, so if you go to the overview and then, so I'm going to put it,
I'll put in the milestones, okay?
01:18:09 - Adrian Boerstra: Okay.
01:18:09 - Adrian Boerstra: And you just go to the portfolio view and move them to where
they'll need to be as you see them from the phone.
01:18:15 - Laura Dolphin: Okay, sounds good.
01:18:16 - Adrian Boerstra: Okay, so the first milestone is application intake and we're going
to do, yeah
01:18:26 - Adrian Boerstra: I'm going to make that Ai-based application intake.
01:18:41 - Adrian Boerstra: Okay, the next one is ownership.
01:18:46 - Laura Dolphin: Oh, I see.
01:18:47 - Laura Dolphin: You can actually just put like the dates I think on there, that level,
can't you?
01:18:53 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah, I can.
01:18:56 - Laura Dolphin: Okay.
01:18:59 - Adrian Boerstra: Ownership and time tracking.
01:19:00 - Adrian Boerstra: You want me to just set, I can set dates here.
01:19:02 - Adrian Boerstra: So that's So yeah, do you want to just start on?
01:19:08 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah, I'll start from the bottom.
01:19:09 - Laura Dolphin: You work from the top.
01:19:10 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah, perfect.
01:19:28 - Laura Dolphin: I don't have access to the bottom project.
01:19:34 - Laura Dolphin: I'll just find one.
01:19:35 - Adrian Boerstra: You start at the top, I'll start at the bottom.
01:19:37 - Laura Dolphin: Sounds good.
01:19:39 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
01:19:39 - Adrian Boerstra: My God.
01:21:31 - Laura Dolphin: Okay.
01:21:36 - Laura Dolphin: There's now like multiple of each.
01:21:38 - Laura Dolphin: Do we care?
01:21:42 - Laura Dolphin: Frustrating.
01:21:43 - Laura Dolphin: Okay.
01:21:46 - Laura Dolphin: I don't.
01:21:51 - Laura Dolphin: Okay.
01:21:58 - Laura Dolphin: Would you not be sick today?
01:22:01 - Adrian Boerstra: That's how I feel right now.
01:22:03 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
01:22:15 - Laura Dolphin: It doesn't let you edit it.
01:22:17 - Laura Dolphin: So sure.
01:22:22 - Laura Dolphin: I honestly.
01:22:24 - Adrian Boerstra: What's the problem?
01:22:25 - Laura Dolphin: Nothing.
01:22:27 - Laura Dolphin: I'm just, yeah, we're good.
01:22:31 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah, I've got
01:22:34 - Adrian Boerstra: I'm looking, I'm seeing all the milestone, like are you seeing my
screen?
01:22:38 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah, yeah.
01:22:41 - Adrian Boerstra: So what were you?
01:22:42 - Laura Dolphin: The dates are really hard, like on the milestones, the dates are not
as easy to describe, but it doesn't matter, I honestly, You can't drag them, you just have to
click into it.
01:22:53 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah, we're just, it's good enough.
01:22:56 - Adrian Boerstra: That's fine.
01:23:04 - Adrian Boerstra: Okay, I'm going to keep on going then.
01:25:17 - Laura Dolphin: Have
01:25:26 - Laura Dolphin: you done the top ones?
01:25:28 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
01:25:32 - Laura Dolphin: I've done all mine.
01:25:33 - Adrian Boerstra: You've done all yours.
01:25:34 - Adrian Boerstra: Okay.
01:25:36 - Adrian Boerstra: I'm going to change the name of the task to match the value
stream since you only get one of those for each.
01:27:08 - Adrian Boerstra: Those bars don't really add anything, do they?
01:27:12 - Laura Dolphin: The bars actually allow you to put in like when you're starting it.
01:27:15 - Laura Dolphin: So these like the milestones just show when they're due.
01:27:18 - Laura Dolphin: So it doesn't really reflect for him like how much time these things
take, but I don't know if that's, I don't know if we care, especially with 15 minutes.
01:27:28 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah, let's just talk about our strategy.
01:27:31 - Adrian Boerstra: We've got this laid out right now.
01:27:33 - Adrian Boerstra: So let's just talk about what we wanna do on this call.
01:27:35 - Adrian Boerstra: And to be honest, I'm open right now to the idea of if we don't
think it's gonna be productive.
01:27:44 - Laura Dolphin: Okay.
01:27:45 - Adrian Boerstra: To pushing this, because I'd rather push it than waste anybody's
time.
01:27:50 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah, I mean, he, so the whole point of the call is to restructure his
Axia.
01:27:55 - Laura Dolphin: We know 30 hours a month is not enough, so I think Dave's coming
in with like a half Fte.
01:28:01 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah, the whole idea is to be able to show Michael, though, like
even with a half Fte, like this is not hours of work.
01:28:09 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah, so it's really just to say like, here's the roadmap for you.
01:28:13 - Laura Dolphin: We can, we can present it as like a, hey, this is like high level.
01:28:16 - Laura Dolphin: And then just to give him an example.
01:28:18 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah, these are the I think one of the things that we plan on
getting done and.
01:28:22 - Adrian Boerstra: And when, and like, this is just, this is a work in progress, but let's
just propose this as a planning tool so that we stay on the same page.
01:28:32 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
01:28:32 - Laura Dolphin: Okay.
01:28:34 - Laura Dolphin: So I might move some of these dates out though.
01:28:36 - Laura Dolphin: So he doesn't get too excited.
01:28:37 - Laura Dolphin: Cause honestly, there's a lot.
01:28:39 - Adrian Boerstra: Let's let's do that right now.
01:28:41 - Adrian Boerstra: Like let's get, let's.
01:28:48 - Laura Dolphin: Okay, so application and take I'm going to move that out.
01:28:53 - Laura Dolphin: That's not a priority.
01:28:55 - Laura Dolphin: I'll move it to like, September.
01:28:59 - Laura Dolphin: Maybe even October.
01:29:01 - Laura Dolphin: But October.
01:29:04 - Laura Dolphin: Aio.
01:29:12 - Laura Dolphin: Phone integration, I'll move that out.
01:29:14 - Laura Dolphin: There's no chance that's going in August.
01:29:15 - Laura Dolphin: I'll put that like December.
01:29:35 - Laura Dolphin: And then I don't like, I think it's probably relevant that you talk to
Michael about like
01:29:40 - Laura Dolphin: little web like the website thing in statement of work but
01:29:46 - Adrian Boerstra: are you talking about the thing that i did for the joint
01:29:50 - Laura Dolphin: yeah just like the sorry i've lost my voice the theory around
01:29:54 - Laura Dolphin: when like any project even if we're using ours from axia
01:29:59 - Laura Dolphin: it's probably good to do like statements of work i floated that idea
by michael
01:30:03 - Adrian Boerstra: yeah okay i see what you're saying yeah just like
01:30:08 - Laura Dolphin: Okay, sorry, we got these are just.
01:30:12 - Laura Dolphin: Silence.
01:30:23 - Laura Dolphin: Can you move all of the ownership and time tracking for me to
September 30th, please.
01:30:28 - Laura Dolphin: Would you be able to do that?
01:30:30 - Adrian Boerstra: move all of the ownership and.
01:30:33 - Laura Dolphin: Yes, all the ownership.
01:30:34 - Laura Dolphin: Just go into the timeline and then just click on anything that says
ownership and time and move them to October 31st, please.
01:30:40 - Laura Dolphin: Yes, thank you.
01:32:00 - Laura Dolphin: Does that look more spread out now?
01:32:03 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah.
01:32:04 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah, Ok.
01:32:11 - Adrian Boerstra: So here's the way I think we should position this call today with
him, is as we get everything worked out, we wanted to just put one single view in front of
him with everything that we're kind of tracking.
01:32:25 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
01:32:26 - Adrian Boerstra: Okay, so we wanted to go through this together, evaluate the
different things that we're looking to do and make sure we all feel it's realistic.
01:32:35 - Adrian Boerstra: And then we'll come back as a second pass with all of the details
behind it.
01:32:40 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
01:32:41 - Adrian Boerstra: Does that sound good?
01:32:42 - Adrian Boerstra: I think that's the only thing we can feasibly do.
01:32:44 - Adrian Boerstra: And I think it makes sense anyway, rather than just.
01:32:48 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah, the only thing is that they have three days until Axia renews.
01:32:52 - Laura Dolphin: So like their new Axia with 30 hours starts June.
01:32:55 - Laura Dolphin: I don't know if Dave's trying to shoot for restructuring it.
01:32:58 - Laura Dolphin: Honestly, I would say that they just need, we know we need more.
01:33:04 - Laura Dolphin: So the data model refresh is like, we know we need to start on that.
01:33:07 - Laura Dolphin: We can make a good start and then transition to a way where we
can just like, kind of put the details for that in here.
01:33:14 - Laura Dolphin: I just don't know how to position the conversation around, like,
even if we go to half Fte, that is not going to be enough to do a lot of these deliverables.
01:33:23 - Laura Dolphin: And he's a very dollars person.
01:33:25 - Laura Dolphin: So I'm just forewarning that the conversation could go awry unless
we're able to give that.
01:33:31 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah, this is where, well, I think maybe let's get on the same page
with Dave real quick.
01:33:39 - Adrian Boerstra: Because he's going to be on this call, right?
01:33:41 - Laura Dolphin: Yep, he's the organizer.
01:33:45 - Laura Dolphin: See if he's available to join us.
01:33:47 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah, I'm going to check right now.
01:33:49 - Adrian Boerstra: Okay.
01:34:35 - Adrian Boerstra: Do you think it's important, like we don't need to go through what
each of these mean with Michael, do we?
01:34:41 - Laura Dolphin: I don't want to, but it's Michael.
01:34:45 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah.
01:34:45 - Laura Dolphin: He gets like, depending on what mood he's in, he'll either get, he'll
just be like, yeah, okay.
01:34:50 - Laura Dolphin: Or he'll be like, he'll just get stuck on one word and he just won't
let it go, which it'll be helpful to have both of you on the call to like assist with that.
01:35:02 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah.
01:35:02 - Laura Dolphin: I'm usually pretty terrible because I'm just kind of like I don't have
time for this but um yeah I depends on what kind of mood is it.
01:35:10 - Adrian Boerstra: Let's just take a moment while we're waiting for Dave.
01:35:12 - Adrian Boerstra: Like we've got sales tax can we just phrase these a little bit better
just put something like if it's a milestone what does sales tax mean what do we get into?
01:35:22 - Laura Dolphin: Um that's a great question.
01:35:24 - Laura Dolphin: Hang on, I don't even know what that's for.
01:35:27 - Laura Dolphin: That's just one of the ones that's been in there for, you know what,
just get rid of it.
01:35:30 - Laura Dolphin: Just delete it.
01:35:31 - Adrian Boerstra: Just get rid of it?
01:35:32 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah, just delete it.
01:35:33 - Laura Dolphin: I don't, it's not worth the like, have to, yeah, perfect.
01:35:37 - Laura Dolphin: What else is, um.
01:35:41 - Adrian Boerstra: I mean, ownership and time tracking, let's at least put in some,
in the description, something more about what that means.
01:35:50 - Adrian Boerstra: is, um, like it's literally, um, met, um, there's, there's three things
that I'm thinking about is, um, so what are we
01:36:04 - Adrian Boerstra: uh, what are the checkpoints that we're capturing?
01:36:11 - Adrian Boerstra: measuring?
01:36:14 - Adrian Boerstra: What are the metrics that we're measuring?
01:36:23 - Adrian Boerstra: What reports or dashboards will this be available or needed for?
01:36:38 - Adrian Boerstra: What blows will this trigger?
01:36:46 - Adrian Boerstra: What notifications will need to happen?
01:36:52 - Adrian Boerstra: And those questions could go with any one of those things, right?
01:36:56 - Adrian Boerstra: every one of the ownership and time tracking tasks.
01:36:59 - Laura Dolphin: Yes.
01:37:00 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
01:37:01 - Adrian Boerstra: So I'm going to just copy and paste that in on every one of our
ownership.
01:37:21 - Adrian Boerstra: It went from not really a project to the project that takes up the
most space on our timeline.
01:37:30 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah, I didn't.
01:37:31 - Laura Dolphin: He'll get stuck on that too.
01:37:33 - Adrian Boerstra: Really?
01:37:34 - Laura Dolphin: Oh, yeah.
01:37:34 - Laura Dolphin: He just gets stuck on everything, the little bit.
01:37:37 - Laura Dolphin: You just never know if it's coming or not.
01:37:40 - Laura Dolphin: Hopefully not.
01:37:47 - Laura Dolphin: He should know.
01:37:48 - Laura Dolphin: It's one of his things that he needs to be able to measure people.
01:37:52 - Adrian Boerstra: So let's just preface this with, this is the goal of our meeting today
is to put forward, first of all, just a workflow for us to roadmap on an ongoing basis.
01:38:07 - Adrian Boerstra: And this is something we want to come back and check together
with him on a monthly basis.
01:38:16 - Adrian Boerstra: Check back on roadmap, but at any given time, we'll continue to
manage along through this.
01:38:23 - Adrian Boerstra: You know, we can adjust things, but this allows us to put a line
in the sand.
01:38:29 - Adrian Boerstra: The other thing is we'll introduce this concept of the value
streams.
01:38:33 - Adrian Boerstra: So we can go through and explain the value streams to them.
01:38:37 - Adrian Boerstra: to them.
01:38:38 - Adrian Boerstra: This gives us a comprehensive way of looking at everything
because we want to make sure that we're maintaining support across all of these value
streams all the time and that we're focused and organized in how we look at it.
01:38:51 - Adrian Boerstra: So, I think we'll we introduced the concept of first of all our goal
for the meeting today is not actually to present a final roadmap.
01:39:01 - Adrian Boerstra: It's to put forward a first draft and a way of being able to work
through it with him.
01:39:08 - Adrian Boerstra: And then let's get aligned on what we want to get done when
01:39:12 - Adrian Boerstra: and then we'll let him know we'll come back within the next, you
know
01:39:15 - Adrian Boerstra: 48 hours around, you know, what we think it's going to take to
get this done
01:39:20 - Adrian Boerstra: within, you know, at the pace that he wants to move at.
01:39:25 - Adrian Boerstra: Because this is...
01:39:27 - Laura Dolphin: I see.
01:39:28 - Laura Dolphin: I just, I think we're setting ourself up for failure.
01:39:30 - Laura Dolphin: I think both him and Dave are actually expecting an actual roadmap
with those details.
01:39:36 - Laura Dolphin: And also just be where I'm on vacation from tomorrow.
01:39:39 - Laura Dolphin: So I have no intentions of until like earliest next Tuesday doing
anything on the bike.
01:39:44 - Laura Dolphin: So just like be very conscious of that.
01:39:47 - Adrian Boerstra: When are you back?
01:39:49 - Laura Dolphin: Next Tuesday.
01:39:51 - Adrian Boerstra: Next Tuesday?
01:39:53 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
01:39:53 - Laura Dolphin: I mean, I'll be like, if I work on anything, it'll be actual work and
support like items items.
01:39:59 - Laura Dolphin: I'm not, I have no plans on doing any of this stuff.
01:40:02 - Laura Dolphin: Just be careful about that.
01:40:04 - Laura Dolphin: I think both of them are expecting like.
01:40:07 - Adrian Boerstra: I know that's what I wanted to get with with.
01:40:09 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
01:40:09 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah.
01:40:10 - Laura Dolphin: That's fair.
01:40:11 - Laura Dolphin: I mean just present it that way and just say like these are the high
level road map.
01:40:15 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah like I can, I'll present it that way at the very beginning say
that's what we're prepared for today.
01:40:20 - Laura Dolphin: Okay.
01:40:21 - Adrian Boerstra: You know we definitely believe that getting all of this stuff done
and even in the time frame we have here is going to take more time.
01:40:30 - Adrian Boerstra: Like, down more than what we've got available.
01:40:33 - Adrian Boerstra: And this is not 30 hours a month.
01:40:35 - Laura Dolphin: No, and I would just make like, I just don't want him to think that
we don't have any of the information that underlies these tasks, because I do.
01:40:44 - Laura Dolphin: Right.
01:40:44 - Laura Dolphin: So make sure that he knows
01:40:46 - Laura Dolphin: like, we're working on a method of presenting this to you in a way
that like, we can use going
01:40:52 - Laura Dolphin: forward, but just say there are a lot of details that Laura has that
sits beneath that will
01:40:58 - Laura Dolphin: give you like full kind of estimates, but we don't know if that's
relevant, right?
01:41:03 - Laura Dolphin: Like I don't want I because...
01:41:05 - Adrian Boerstra: Within Asana what we can do is use each one of these value
streams as projects, so we can just add in, I think we should start to take like as we identify
these milestones, will line up all of the tasks.
01:41:21 - Adrian Boerstra: And I do like the visual, from a visual perspective.
01:41:26 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah, the only thing is that Dave kind of vetoed that and was trying
to push forward on the Jira thing, like giving us- Oh, I don't want to do it instead of Jira.
01:41:33 - Adrian Boerstra: Well, I want to solve on the Jira integration.
01:41:40 - Laura Dolphin: Okay, yeah, I agree.
01:41:41 - Laura Dolphin: I just, I would be careful.
01:41:42 - Laura Dolphin: I don't know if like Dave's like good with that or like I just, I don't
know.
01:41:48 - Adrian Boerstra: But he'll be good with it.
01:41:50 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah, it's not a good tool.
01:41:52 - Laura Dolphin: I was going to say, even if you just don't even show Asana as a
tool and almost just screenshot that timeline, make that an image, and then just bring the
image up so nobody gets stuck on the actual tool behind it, if you know what I mean.
