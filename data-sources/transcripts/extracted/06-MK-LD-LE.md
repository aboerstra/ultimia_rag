Faye x Maxim Weekly Transcript
00:12 - Laura Dolphin: Hello.
00:13 - Lyndon Elam: Can you hear me now?
00:14 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
00:15 - Lyndon Elam: All right.
00:16 - Lyndon Elam: Good, good.
00:16 - Lyndon Elam: Hold on a quick second.
00:18 - Laura Dolphin: Hey.
00:18 - Lyndon Elam: Hey.
00:21 - Laura Dolphin: Hey.
00:22 - Michael Kianmahd: Hey.
00:22 - Michael Kianmahd: Your buddy's here today.
00:25 - Laura Dolphin: Oh, hello.
00:28 - Laura Dolphin: Oh, jealous.
00:29 - Laura Dolphin: I want cuddles so much.
00:35 - Lyndon Elam: All right.
00:39 - Laura Dolphin: Okay.
00:40 - Laura Dolphin: I don't know.
00:42 - Laura Dolphin: Are we okay to get started?
00:43 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah.
00:44 - Laura Dolphin: Okay, cool.
00:50 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah, I can share screen.
00:53 - Laura Dolphin: Okay, so I'll just give like a time update.
00:55 - Laura Dolphin: I don't want to spend too much time on the time.
00:58 - Laura Dolphin: If you have additional questions, I recommend just reconnecting with
Sarah.
01:02 - Laura Dolphin: However, I did.
01:05 - Laura Dolphin: put a note so that you should be able to just get any like additional
overage bills at the end of the quarter, which is end of October.
01:13 - Laura Dolphin: So if you do accidentally receive like a bill.
01:17 - Laura Dolphin: in the next week or two, just reply back and cc me and I'll handle it.
01:22 - Michael Kianmahd: Okay.
01:23 - Laura Dolphin: Cool.
01:25 - Laura Dolphin: That's where we're at.
01:25 - Laura Dolphin: We are in a new month, but still in the same quarter.
01:29 - Laura Dolphin: These are confusing.
01:30 - Laura Dolphin: So these times here are for September, but we have started tracking
against the October projects.
01:36 - Laura Dolphin: There's like a few hours on each of those already.
01:41 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
01:42 - Laura Dolphin: Any questions on that?
01:44 - Michael Kianmahd: I don't think so.
01:45 - Michael Kianmahd: Okay.
01:47 - Laura Dolphin: I do have one.
01:48 - Laura Dolphin: So I had a topic for the steering.
01:51 - Laura Dolphin: I had canceled the steering.
01:52 - Laura Dolphin: I thought I could handle it with just Louis, but it kind of.
01:56 - Laura Dolphin: circled um so i'm going to raise it with you guys and then if we can't
solve it um or you let me know if it needs to have like a separate conversation or it's a steering
committee
02:08 - Laura Dolphin: request.
02:10 - Laura Dolphin: So what the issue that we're trying to solve for is like the direct deals.
02:16 - Laura Dolphin: So basically when Fernando, because he works for Maxim.
02:20 - Laura Dolphin: When he is...
02:23 - Laura Dolphin: And basically he acts as like the referral source contact on a deal.
02:27 - Laura Dolphin: And I think for the most part, these are like clients who've already had
funding or if he just reaches out directly.
02:33 - Laura Dolphin: Then what happens is the intake team creates an opportunity and
they put him as a referral source contact.
02:41 - Laura Dolphin: And technically the broker can either be.
02:45 - Laura Dolphin: currency capital or
02:48 - Laura Dolphin: no one, which is like Fernando at Maxim.
02:52 - Laura Dolphin: Okay.
02:52 - Laura Dolphin: So Louie reached out and just said, Hey, this, like the system prevents
us from doing it the way that we want to do it, basically leaving the broker blank because our
current validation rules basically say that like, if you don't have a broker or if it's this broker
and your dealer incentives and your commissions have to be like.
03:14 - Laura Dolphin: X percentage.
03:16 - Laura Dolphin: So I kind of reviewed it and first I was like, well,
03:19 - Laura Dolphin: if Fernando is submitting deals on both of on behalf of both like
currency capital as a broker and then Maxim as a broker does it not make sense to have
Maxim as the broker
03:30 - Laura Dolphin: because you like you have currency capital as a broker but you're just
recording nobody um and
03:36 - Laura Dolphin: Louis said yes, but Jay said no.
03:39 - Laura Dolphin: So first of all, do you guys, do you know which issue I'm talking about?
03:43 - Laura Dolphin: And does this make sense?
03:46 - Michael Kianmahd: I don't know the nuance of what you're talking about, Laura, but
I'll kind of tell you in layman's terms, and I think it would be valuable for you and Lynn to just
have this context.
03:56 - Michael Kianmahd: So there is a partner that is owned by Sandhills Publishing.
04:05 - Michael Kianmahd: Sandhills Publishing has a bunch of periodicals like Truck Paper
Machinery Trader.
04:11 - Michael Kianmahd: and a bunch of other sort of like online assets that help people
sell.
04:17 - Michael Kianmahd: equipment.
04:17 - Michael Kianmahd: Okay.
04:19 - Michael Kianmahd: Sandhills Publishing acquired currency capital.
04:23 - Michael Kianmahd: Currency Capital had a partnership with Sandhills where they
had a banner on all their websites.
04:29 - Michael Kianmahd: And when somebody looking to buy a truck or looking to buy a
piece of yellow iron would click on the currency page.
04:35 - Michael Kianmahd: and would help that client get financing.
04:37 - Michael Kianmahd: So now currency capital is basically like a captive.
04:41 - Michael Kianmahd: broker for all the customers buying trucks or trailers or heavy
equipment from all the Sandhill publishing sites.
04:50 - Michael Kianmahd: But they totally shifted the business model.
04:53 - Michael Kianmahd: And they basically said, like, listen, these Maxim deals are much
higher touch than...
04:58 - Michael Kianmahd: you know, we would like to invest in them.
05:02 - Michael Kianmahd: So we'd be happy to continue to refer you deals, but you're going
to have to work them internally.
05:07 - Michael Kianmahd: So currency capital is technically a broker, but they don't work
the deals the same way that let's say...
05:12 - Lyndon Elam: Michael, what do you mean by work them internally?
05:16 - Michael Kianmahd: like having customer communications that a broker or vendor
would typically have.
05:22 - Michael Kianmahd: It's just much more taxing on us to close one of those deals
because Fernando has to handhold the customer and negotiate with them and explain
things to them.
05:30 - Michael Kianmahd: and basically do the kind of review of the transaction and
coordinate the signing and the pickup and drop off and all that other stuff.
05:38 - Michael Kianmahd: it's like way more taxing on Fernando to close those deals.
05:41 - Lyndon Elam: Got it.
05:42 - Michael Kianmahd: Well,
05:43 - Michael Kianmahd: Organizationally, we're not built really to do direct.
05:48 - Michael Kianmahd: But when they come in and they look like compelling deals, you
know, this is actually initially what Fernando was hired for was to work these leads.
05:56 - Michael Kianmahd: And his opportunity was much bigger than just working.
06:01 - Michael Kianmahd: So we just basically.
06:03 - Michael Kianmahd: He allowed these to kind of fall in the background.
06:07 - Michael Kianmahd: But he
06:08 - Laura Dolphin: will
06:08 - Michael Kianmahd: pick them up from time to time when he has capacity, which
lately he's had more capacity.
06:12 - Michael Kianmahd: OK.
06:14 - Michael Kianmahd: with the concept of the validation rule.
06:18 - Michael Kianmahd: not allowing us to put a deal in as not having a broker.
06:24 - Michael Kianmahd: Doesn't make intuitive sense to me.
06:25 - Michael Kianmahd: There are plenty of deals that we see from vendors.
06:30 - Michael Kianmahd: where there is not a broker involved.
06:32 - Laura Dolphin: It's
06:33 - Michael Kianmahd: just directly from a vendor.
06:34 - Michael Kianmahd: So if there is a validation rule that basically blocks us out.
06:38 - Michael Kianmahd: Okay.
06:40 - Michael Kianmahd: Sorry for the noise.
06:41 - Michael Kianmahd: This dog is like digging as if he's in a playground or something.
06:44 - Laura Dolphin: I
06:44 - Lyndon Elam: can't hear
06:45 - Michael Kianmahd: it.
06:46 - Michael Kianmahd: Hanky.
06:47 - Michael Kianmahd: Hey.
06:51 - Michael Kianmahd: If there's a validation rule that...
06:53 - Michael Kianmahd: that basically blocks out somebody from entering a deal without
a broker, that should be probably
06:57 - Lyndon Elam: corrected.
06:59 - Michael Kianmahd: If there is a specific currency validation rule, when currency is
entered as a broker, that's fine.
07:06 - Michael Kianmahd: If there's a separate validation rule that we come up with, where
if the referral source is somebody that just randomly went on the website
07:14 - Lyndon Elam: and
07:14 - Michael Kianmahd: applied directly, and there's no vendor tack to it and no broker
tack to it, and for whatever reason, Fernando feels like working with his customer.
07:23 - Michael Kianmahd: we should have a validation rule that says like if Fernando is an
owner
07:28 - Michael Kianmahd: And if there is no broker, then why happens?
07:32 - Laura Dolphin: Okay, so there's two issues.
07:34 - Laura Dolphin: The validation rules can be fixed.
07:36 - Laura Dolphin: that's a longer conversation so Lynn you might remember I called out
like
07:40 - Laura Dolphin: they're they're doing the controlling of current commissions and
incentives at opportunity level like fields with validations which is like we probably want to
change that in future so there's that and that's at hand and that's one of the things and then
the other way is the way that we've built it to intake deals so what the actual question is is
when Fernando is like he's technically the referral source contact and we need that referral
source contact
08:09 - Laura Dolphin: for like whoever is doing the docs.
08:12 - Laura Dolphin: So if that's the case, like Fernando is actually going to be submitting
all the documents for AIO, things like that.
08:18 - Laura Dolphin: So if we have Fernando, but he does deals, like he is a referral source
contact for both.
08:23 - Laura Dolphin: currency and maxim like which is essentially nobody
08:29 - Laura Dolphin: The question is around more so like, how do we handle his contact
record?
08:33 - Laura Dolphin: because he's technically one person and he's got one email address,
but he's trying to, we're trying to represent that.
08:40 - Laura Dolphin: He is brokering a deal on behalf of either Currency or Maxim.
08:45 - Laura Dolphin: And then like when it, when it.
08:49 - Laura Dolphin: what I'm trying to understand is your reporting requirements and like
if
08:54 - Laura Dolphin: Do you need him as the referral source contact?
08:56 - Laura Dolphin: Do you, if you do, do you want to be able to report that like Maxim is
the.
09:02 - Laura Dolphin: the source of that.
09:03 - Laura Dolphin: That's kind of what I'm getting at.
09:04 - Laura Dolphin: Like, I feel like it's not just fixing the validation rules because I can do
that.
09:09 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah, I think you tell us like what's the best way to tag?
09:15 - Michael Kianmahd: a lead or an account or an opportunity that's like a maximum
source leader account or opportunity that has no broker or dealer.
09:23 - Michael Kianmahd: that it was referred from.
09:26 - Laura Dolphin: Well, I guess if you need, so does Fernando actually do, if he submits
it for Maxim, is he actually doing the like.
09:33 - Laura Dolphin: dock loading through AIO?
09:35 - Michael Kianmahd: He's not.
09:36 - Michael Kianmahd: I think we probably sent it to a customer.
09:38 - Laura Dolphin: He's
09:39 - Michael Kianmahd: not meeting the customer directly.
09:42 - Laura Dolphin: Okay.
09:42 - Laura Dolphin: Like
09:42 - Michael Kianmahd: in person.
09:44 - Michael Kianmahd: Imagine like a customer sitting at a dealership.
09:47 - Michael Kianmahd: That's not happening.
09:49 - Laura Dolphin: Okay.
09:50 - Laura Dolphin: So in that case, it's probably more so a restructure of the way that we
have the deal intake automation.
09:59 - Laura Dolphin: Louis brought it and said, I'm trying to submit it so that Fernando is
like the referral source contact, but we don't actually need to have him here.
10:08 - Laura Dolphin: We can really just use our opportunity contact roles.
10:11 - Laura Dolphin: to add him because that's what we use for AIO.
10:14 - Laura Dolphin: And then we, we should almost have like a direct intake where the
custom, we just do it from the customer and we just like skip out the whole broker section.
10:24 - Laura Dolphin: Currency capital is like different because that's an actual, there's a
broker.
10:27 - Laura Dolphin: If it's a direct deal, then it's really just a customer and then a dealer.
10:32 - Laura Dolphin: Does
10:35 - Michael Kianmahd: that make, is that correct?
10:36 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah, yeah,
10:36 - Michael Kianmahd: totally.
10:36 - Michael Kianmahd: So,
10:37 - Laura Dolphin: I
10:37 - Michael Kianmahd: mean, if you think about it, like kind of next layer.
10:40 - Michael Kianmahd: So like, let's say a customer applies to us directly.
10:43 - Michael Kianmahd: and is not referred to us and they're applying for financing.
10:47 - Michael Kianmahd: They could be buying a truck.
10:48 - Michael Kianmahd: They could be looking to just get like cash out refinancing on a
piece of real estate.
10:54 - Michael Kianmahd: They could be buying a piece of yellow iron.
10:57 - Michael Kianmahd: There could or could not be a dealer involved.
11:01 - Michael Kianmahd: Right?
11:01 - Michael Kianmahd: So just because there's a dealer involved, it doesn't mean the
deal came from that referral source.
11:06 - Michael Kianmahd: It could have been a customer direct application.
11:09 - Michael Kianmahd: where they like went on our website or went on Google, found
out about us and applied or reached out to us.
11:14 - Michael Kianmahd: How we differentiate that in Salesforce, I will defer to you on best
practice based on the data that we have.
11:23 - Laura Dolphin: Okay.
11:25 - Michael Kianmahd: By the way, in terms of priorities, if there's a one or two or three,
this is a three.
11:30 - Laura Dolphin: So the reason that it's come up is because what Louie and his team
are doing is like a workaround and I don't want it to cause long-term data issues because of
the way it's structured.
11:44 - Laura Dolphin: So, yeah, but I didn't want to just change the validations that we have
like another validation rule.
11:51 - Laura Dolphin: I just, yeah, so I just wanted to more understand it.
11:53 - Laura Dolphin: So that makes sense.
11:54 - Lyndon Elam: Laura, for the example you've brought up here, we already have
Fernando as the salesperson, right?
12:00 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah, because he's technically the salesperson and he's like the
referral first contact.
12:06 - Lyndon Elam: This isn't exactly a direct deal, but it's...
12:10 - Laura Dolphin: This one isn't, no.
12:11 - Laura Dolphin: So, um...
12:13 - Laura Dolphin: trying to think what it will look like is
12:16 - Lyndon Elam: he'll
12:16 - Laura Dolphin: just not have the
12:17 - Lyndon Elam: way the way he's the way he's working it
12:21 - Lyndon Elam: feels like how a direct deal might be worked.
12:26 - Lyndon Elam: Some sort of, right?
12:28 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah.
12:29 - Lyndon Elam: Can we tag it like that for that channel at the channel level?
12:34 - Lyndon Elam: and then we're not creating a new field and we're able to leverage the
salesperson field.
12:43 - Laura Dolphin: Yes.
12:44 - Laura Dolphin: Sigh.
12:47 - Laura Dolphin: I have to think about that.
12:49 - Laura Dolphin: They have so much tied.
12:50 - Laura Dolphin: So like this is, these are all like the old stuff, which are not going away
right now because they have so much else tied to it.
12:59 - Laura Dolphin: But there's a lot that is tied to this.
13:01 - Laura Dolphin: So I might just need to do a little bit more digging to find out where.
13:05 - Laura Dolphin: when it's an actual direct deal, if we need this at all.
13:11 - Laura Dolphin: In which case, if we don't, then I would probably just omit it.
13:16 - Laura Dolphin: And just, as you said, have like Fernando is the salesperson so that
there's no broker, there's no referral source contact.
13:22 - Laura Dolphin: He's just the salesperson working the deal.
13:25 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah, I would also I think probably Jay was the one that would
come up with these kind of tactical ways of handling things
13:33 - Laura Dolphin: with
13:33 - Michael Kianmahd: Salesforce and then you would be the implementer of it.
13:37 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
13:38 - Laura Dolphin: he called that out too he said like i did it this way because to no better
way to do it um
13:42 - Michael Kianmahd: but
13:43 - Laura Dolphin: he said at the end of the day like maxim is not a broker so
13:47 - Michael Kianmahd: Did you talk to Jay about it?
13:49 - Laura Dolphin: So yeah, I had a call with Louie to understand it.
13:52 - Laura Dolphin: And then I just did a chat with Jay and Fernando and Louie just to get
their input and get a little bit.
13:59 - Laura Dolphin: And then I kind of just said, okay, I need to have a conversation to
understand this.
14:02 - Laura Dolphin: So, okay, I've got enough.
14:03 - Laura Dolphin: I'll have to think about that.
14:06 - Laura Dolphin: And if I need to circle back, I will.
14:08 - Laura Dolphin: Otherwise, I'll just make the adjustments as need be with the team.
14:12 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah, perfect.
14:14 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah.
14:16 - Michael Kianmahd: So just know in your mind that like.
14:19 - Michael Kianmahd: Currency technically is still a broker.
14:22 - Michael Kianmahd: There's a separate commission schedule that's a little bit lower
than what we pay other brokers.
14:26 - Michael Kianmahd: So like there are kind of reasons for how we came up with that.
14:28 - Michael Kianmahd: So if you wanted to just preview anything together.
14:31 - Michael Kianmahd: And the key people would be like...
14:34 - Michael Kianmahd: Fernando, Jay, Louis, maybe myself.
14:37 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah, no, I'm good with those.
14:39 - Laura Dolphin: The rules as they stand today for the commissions and stuff for
currency are fine.
14:44 - Laura Dolphin: That's not the issue.
14:46 - Laura Dolphin: It's more the other stuff.
14:48 - Laura Dolphin: So yeah, okay.
14:50 - Laura Dolphin: Um, I'm good on that for now
14:53 - Laura Dolphin: So data model.
14:56 - Laura Dolphin: So I'll just give you kind of like an update of where we are.
15:01 - Laura Dolphin: We've added some or changed some of the functionality for the
contact rules.
15:05 - Laura Dolphin: We did this last week just to...
15:07 - Laura Dolphin: to support the changes that were made for the doc merge.
15:14 - Laura Dolphin: So I'm going to just...
15:15 - Laura Dolphin: ask if you think the steering committee would be the right place for
that to just kind of like bring everyone up to speed.
15:22 - Laura Dolphin: Technically, I'm already starting UAT today.
15:25 - Laura Dolphin: I'm doing it in kind of like targeted bits with relevant users to get them
kind of like up to speed, make sure they have access.
15:34 - Laura Dolphin: test something live and then when we actually have everything in the
full coffee sandbox which will hopefully be tomorrow or monday um then i'll be able to just
say okay guys go and do like the full
15:45 - Laura Dolphin: you know, do a full heavy equipment intake, do a full structure deal,
do a full whatever.
15:52 - Laura Dolphin: Are we happy to just do like a kind of a reset review on Monday at
the steering committee and just like, cause people haven't seen it probably in a few weeks
at least.
16:00 - Michael Kianmahd: Yes, I'm good at that.
16:01 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah, okay.
16:04 - Laura Dolphin: So we did get the pricing tool just an hour ago.
16:07 - Laura Dolphin: It successfully connected with the sandbox.
16:10 - Laura Dolphin: Ken had to do a bunch of stuff on there and to create an actual like
staging environment, basically.
16:19 - Laura Dolphin: And then we've shifted the way that we hold the credentials.
16:22 - Laura Dolphin: So it's a bit more robust and repeatable.
16:26 - Laura Dolphin: So now that I've made everyone do all of that, we're going to do it in
the full sandbox, which should take much less time because we're just like re-authenticating.
16:34 - Laura Dolphin: And that, because that's our UAT, but that's a win.
16:38 - Laura Dolphin: It tested good today.
16:41 - Laura Dolphin: It worked as expected.
16:44 - Laura Dolphin: All the data was flowing back and forth.
16:45 - Laura Dolphin: So pending any issues that UAT users find, we're good on the scoring,
all scoring kin.
16:54 - Michael Kianmahd: Great.
16:55 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
16:56 - Laura Dolphin: And then, yeah, I mentioned UIT is going to start today.
16:58 - Laura Dolphin: So I'm going to work with Louie and Jay on kind of like the first parts
and go through like some special use cases just to make sure that they're like happy with
that.
17:07 - Laura Dolphin: And then I'm going to start bringing on, I'll be scheduling a few other
sessions for next week.
17:14 - Laura Dolphin: to get other users on, like comparing reporting and then doing the full
end-to-end.
17:18 - Laura Dolphin: And I'm currently targeting the week of October 20th for the deploy-
ment for the data model to prod.
17:24 - Laura Dolphin: Do you have any issues or...
17:27 - Laura Dolphin: concerned around that date.
17:28 - Laura Dolphin: I would do it the week prior, but I'm a dream force.
17:31 - Laura Dolphin: So.
17:32 - Laura Dolphin: I
17:32 - Michael Kianmahd: think we're good.
17:33 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
17:35 - Laura Dolphin: Okay.
17:36 - Laura Dolphin: And then my only question is, Lynn, I know we're meeting.
17:40 - Laura Dolphin: later today.
17:42 - Laura Dolphin: But the sales stage stuff.
17:44 - Laura Dolphin: Is that like going to be after we do this data model?
17:48 - Laura Dolphin: or are you hoping that all of those changes will be incorporated?
17:55 - Lyndon Elam: I don't think so.
17:55 - Lyndon Elam: I don't see it as urgent.
17:57 - Lyndon Elam: I see it...
17:59 - Lyndon Elam: I'm trying to get the mappings from a reporting standpoint.
18:04 - Lyndon Elam: So no, it's...
18:06 - Laura Dolphin: Okay.
18:07 - Lyndon Elam: Yeah, I think we can view it as a future state discussion.
18:11 - Laura Dolphin: Okay, then you and I can circle back to that and our call.
18:16 - Laura Dolphin: I might be able to show you the full copy sandbox too, because I've
applied all of the new sales stages there.
18:21 - Laura Dolphin: So you can like look at the actual data and compare it against prod
to see if it is what you're after.
18:28 - Lyndon Elam: And
18:28 - Laura Dolphin: if not, then you can call it like, this is not what I want.
18:31 - Laura Dolphin: So.
18:32 - Laura Dolphin: Okay.
18:32 - Laura Dolphin: That's all I have for today.
18:38 - Laura Dolphin: What else do you have?
18:40 - Michael Kianmahd: Lynn, anything on the reporting, sort of like acute reporting needs
that maybe Laura could support
18:45 - Lyndon Elam: on?
18:45 - Lyndon Elam: That's what she and I have been working on.
18:51 - Lyndon Elam: I set up time with her for a little bit later today to...
18:56 - Lyndon Elam: to look at those stages.
18:57 - Lyndon Elam: You know, Michael, you and I had the discussion.
19:00 - Lyndon Elam: and Laura had sent me something that shows the mapping of the plan
go-to stages.
19:07 - Lyndon Elam: And I just want to make sure that we've got, you know, one-to-one.
19:11 - Lyndon Elam: tracking on stuff and also where there's opportunity to simplify without
19:17 - Lyndon Elam: encumbering the process.
19:20 - Lyndon Elam: So that's what I'm covering with her.
19:23 - Lyndon Elam: From a reporting standpoint.
19:25 - Lyndon Elam: I mean, no, I've put Laura on notice that, hey, I'm going to be working
on...
19:30 - Lyndon Elam: building out some stuff and as i'm doing that i'm going to have
questions and so
19:34 - Lyndon Elam: So I'm just reaching out to her and setting up time as...
19:37 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
19:38 - Lyndon Elam: That's how it arises.
19:40 - Laura Dolphin: And that works for me.
19:42 - Michael Kianmahd: Just let me know.
19:43 - Michael Kianmahd: Just as like a.
19:45 - Michael Kianmahd: or visibility or any sort of perspective that...
19:49 - Michael Kianmahd: I can provide in those discussions.
19:50 - Michael Kianmahd: Let me know.
19:51 - Lyndon Elam: Yeah.
19:52 - Lyndon Elam: I think when we get to decisions.
19:54 - Lyndon Elam: then I want to make sure your eyes are on it.
19:58 - Michael Kianmahd: Cool.
19:58 - Lyndon Elam: And so we're aligned.
20:02 - Laura Dolphin: I did just think of one as a, I forgot to put it on here, but I know you're
working on the credit data for the storage.
20:13 - Laura Dolphin: do you want me to put something as like a marker so we don't like
forget about that just because I'm
20:20 - Laura Dolphin: I don't want you to get to the point when you're at like 95% capacity
and then we either have to get you like purchased more or.
20:28 - Lyndon Elam: Yeah.
20:30 - Lyndon Elam: Yes.
20:33 - Lyndon Elam: What's your best guess on how far out is that before we hit?
20:37 - Lyndon Elam: one of
20:37 - Laura Dolphin: those.
20:39 - Laura Dolphin: Let me do that.
20:41 - Lyndon Elam: Weeks, months.
20:43 - Laura Dolphin: Let's check now.
20:44 - Laura Dolphin: And if it's still at 80, I think it was at 82 or 86.
20:47 - Laura Dolphin: I think.
20:50 - Laura Dolphin: Storage.
20:57 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah, so it's not going up very fast.
21:01 - Laura Dolphin: I would say you're months away.
21:04 - Laura Dolphin: The thing that I'm calling out is that if it's one of those where we have
to put in like jobs or we have to go and do like a mass deletion, I just have to kind of like plan
for that work.
21:14 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah,
21:15 - Lyndon Elam: how much, what's the lead time you need on something like that?
21:18 - Lyndon Elam: If, for
21:18 - Laura Dolphin: example,
21:19 - Lyndon Elam: we said...
21:20 - Lyndon Elam: We want to flush all of this type of information.
21:26 - Lyndon Elam: for record, seven years or older or 10 years or older or whatever.
21:29 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
21:30 - Laura Dolphin: If it's just like deletion, then we can probably turn that around in like
a week or so.
21:35 - Lyndon Elam: That's
21:35 - Laura Dolphin: our big deal.
21:36 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
21:36 - Laura Dolphin: If we're talking about like working with.
21:41 - Laura Dolphin: Leaseworks to, sorry.
21:45 - Laura Dolphin: Laser credit to amend the data, that's a lot longer.
21:51 - Laura Dolphin: if we're talking about like we create some sort of automation or like
job in salesforce that like
21:59 - Laura Dolphin: after X amount of time.
22:01 - Laura Dolphin: You know what I mean?
22:02 - Laura Dolphin: So it just really depends on what your requirements are.
22:06 - Laura Dolphin: The automation and the deletion.
22:08 - Laura Dolphin: turnaround quicker.
22:10 - Laura Dolphin: The laser one, I don't even know if that's possible, but that would
probably be a lot harder to do because it's multiple parties and stuff like that.
22:17 - Laura Dolphin: So.
22:18 - Lyndon Elam: Okay.
22:18 - Lyndon Elam: Yeah.
22:20 - Laura Dolphin: I'm just calling that out.
22:22 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah, there's not really a rush.
22:23 - Laura Dolphin: I just I don't want to be at like 95% and then be like, Oh, crap, we got
to get this done.
22:29 - Laura Dolphin: I'd rather kind of like plan for it and just have a lot more.
22:33 - Laura Dolphin: storage
22:34 - Michael Kianmahd: laura if you go back to that screen just like
22:36 - Laura Dolphin: yeah
22:37 - Michael Kianmahd: in the couple years or so that i've been involved in this they
typically reach out to you after you've breached it
22:45 - Laura Dolphin: Well, they do.
22:46 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah, they think they usually start at like.
22:49 - Laura Dolphin: 95 but yeah they do
22:51 - Michael Kianmahd: yeah and then um there's a way to add
22:55 - Michael Kianmahd: Ta-da.
22:58 - Michael Kianmahd: If you go to, do you have access to the ordering?
23:02 - Michael Kianmahd: Peace.
23:03 - Michael Kianmahd: What
23:03 - Laura Dolphin: do you mean by ordering?
23:04 - Laura Dolphin: Oh, yeah, yeah.
23:05 - Laura Dolphin: At your account?
23:06 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah.
23:07 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
23:08 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
23:09 - Laura Dolphin: You can purchase more.
23:10 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah.
23:10 - Michael Kianmahd: So it's.
23:11 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
23:11 - Laura Dolphin: But that's money that you potentially don't need to spend.
23:14 - Laura Dolphin: Right.
23:15 - Laura Dolphin: So.
23:16 - Michael Kianmahd: Totally.
23:16 - Michael Kianmahd: So just click browse and buy.
23:18 - Michael Kianmahd: Just I just want Lynn to be aware of this.
23:23 - Lyndon Elam: I'm surprised they buried spending money so deep into their tool.
23:27 - Michael Kianmahd: Everything is deep with Salesforce.
23:30 - Laura Dolphin: I don't know if I actually, yeah, I don't think I'm allowed to actually buy
it,
23:33 - Michael Kianmahd: but yeah, just look for data.
23:43 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
23:43 - Laura Dolphin: That's well as customer data cloud, where's the sales cloud one.
23:50 - Michael Kianmahd: There you go.
23:52 - Michael Kianmahd: So for like...
23:55 - Michael Kianmahd: $1,500 a year can add half a gig.
23:59 - Lyndon Elam: Yeah,
24:01 - Michael Kianmahd: so it's not like very expensive
24:04 - Lyndon Elam: Yeah.
24:06 - Michael Kianmahd: And then one thing that I'm also super sensitive to is like.
24:11 - Michael Kianmahd: uh you know if we ever wanted to pull data and all of a sudden
like data's not there and it's like sitting somewhere else it's like archived in a spreadsheet
then you're basically signing up for this effort of like
24:21 - Michael Kianmahd: pulling everything together and flattening it and making it
consistent.
24:25 - Michael Kianmahd: So I think that's a material risk.
24:29 - Michael Kianmahd: This is like the BLTR issue that we ran into where it wasn't in
Salesforce.
24:35 - Michael Kianmahd: So we just kind of had a gap of what we were able to see.
24:40 - Michael Kianmahd: And then also anytime you add a license.
24:44 - Michael Kianmahd: you end up getting more data storage.
24:46 - Michael Kianmahd: So as we add licenses, with that, we'll get more data storage and
file storage, theoretically.
24:53 - Michael Kianmahd: And then another thing we can do is if we have like a couple of
rounds of licenses we want to buy, we can also hold up those purchases as a sort of
25:02 - Lyndon Elam: like
25:02 - Michael Kianmahd: a contingency to adding it with them.
25:04 - Michael Kianmahd: So it doesn't always have to cost us more incrementally.
25:09 - Michael Kianmahd: I have been like three, four months like
25:13 - Michael Kianmahd: where we had storage utilization in excess of capacity and they
didn't do anything.
25:17 - Michael Kianmahd: They were just like...
25:19 - Michael Kianmahd: you know, how can we help you is like kind of the tone of their
conversation, which means how can we screw you?
25:24 - Michael Kianmahd: but that's just been their, their way of talking about it.
25:28 - Michael Kianmahd: So it's not a real issue in my mind.
25:32 - Lyndon Elam: Okay.
25:33 - Laura Dolphin: I'm good with it if you are.
25:35 - Laura Dolphin: Some customers are definitely not.
25:37 - Laura Dolphin: So.
25:41 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah, I mean, if there's a better way to do this, like, like.
25:46 - Michael Kianmahd: you know, 10 year old data could be removed.
25:47 - Michael Kianmahd: But I was looking at the, I was looking at what you had shown
us in terms of like how it was being utilized.
25:52 - Michael Kianmahd: Like I saw Plotty was half a gigabyte.
25:57 - Laura Dolphin: memory yeah but you can like i'll delete and archive and stuff jobs
after they've
26:01 - Michael Kianmahd: yeah i
26:01 - Laura Dolphin: don't need them yeah
26:03 - Michael Kianmahd: can you go back to that the utilization
26:04 - Lyndon Elam: what's what's pilate
26:06 - Laura Dolphin: Potty do duplicate check.
26:11 - Michael Kianmahd: That's like a new thing we implemented.
26:13 - Lyndon Elam: Okay.
26:14 - Michael Kianmahd: Basically like houses de-dupe.
26:17 - Michael Kianmahd: contacts and the account
26:19 - Lyndon Elam: oh i got it got it got
26:20 - Laura Dolphin: it
26:20 - Lyndon Elam: okay and
26:21 - Michael Kianmahd: it does it like in a scalable way
26:24 - Laura Dolphin: And I can you can use it in APIs and flows and
26:28 - Laura Dolphin: preventative and stuff like that.
26:32 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah.
26:32 - Michael Kianmahd: So if you look at like where the utilization is, it's mostly trade
accounts.
26:38 - Michael Kianmahd: So basically credit bureau data.
26:40 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
26:41 - Laura Dolphin: Both of these are the top two are.
26:44 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
26:44 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah.
26:44 - Michael Kianmahd: And then the third is email messages.
26:47 - Michael Kianmahd: So like really old insurance email messages.
26:52 - Michael Kianmahd: Like if we can parse out like, Hey, email messages that were sent
out.
26:58 - Michael Kianmahd: 10 years ago,
26:59 - Laura Dolphin: we can
27:00 - Michael Kianmahd: probably, it's not going to change like a credit model in any way.
27:05 - Laura Dolphin: yeah
27:06 - Michael Kianmahd: so like you know that if there's a way that we can kind of parse
out that level of communication and kind of keep everything else that would definitely be
something we can do
27:15 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah, okay.
27:17 - Laura Dolphin: We've already got rid of almost all of the objects that we got rid of
like 26 objects in the last six months or so, from which we're like never used or not used
anymore.
27:30 - Laura Dolphin: So, yeah.
27:33 - Laura Dolphin: Okay, cool.
27:35 - Laura Dolphin: Well, then I'll leave that one with you.
27:36 - Laura Dolphin: Let me know what you need from me if you need anything.
27:38 - Laura Dolphin: If you guys want to just leave it and just purchase, I'm happy with that.
27:42 - Laura Dolphin: But yeah.
27:43 - Michael Kianmahd: When we
27:45 - Lyndon Elam: have
27:45 - Michael Kianmahd: half a gig left, let us know.
27:47 - Laura Dolphin: Okay.
27:49 - Laura Dolphin: And then we'll scramble and be like, oh crap.
27:51 - Laura Dolphin: It's
27:51 - Michael Kianmahd: not, it's not going to.
27:53 - Michael Kianmahd: It's not going to be used that quickly.
27:55 - Laura Dolphin: All right.
27:55 - Laura Dolphin: No worries.
27:56 - Laura Dolphin: Okay.
27:56 - Laura Dolphin: Well, I've got a call with Louie in two minutes.
27:58 - Laura Dolphin: Is there anything else for today?
28:00 - Laura Dolphin: Anything you need?
28:02 - Michael Kianmahd: You know, I was showing Lynn some of the automated emails
that go out for insurance, and I was also showing him.
28:10 - Michael Kianmahd: what the approval template looks like.
28:13 - Lyndon Elam: And
28:13 - Michael Kianmahd: one thing that I don't think we've talked about yet is how approval
templates will shift once everything's merged.
28:21 - Michael Kianmahd: Okay.
28:24 - Michael Kianmahd: Go ahead.
28:25 - Laura Dolphin: No, you go ahead.
28:27 - Michael Kianmahd: So right now the approval template is very TR focused.
28:30 - Laura Dolphin: It's
28:31 - Michael Kianmahd: not branded.
28:33 - Michael Kianmahd: It could probably be cleaned up a little bit.
28:35 - Michael Kianmahd: That's something I wanted to flag that came to mind this week.
28:39 - Laura Dolphin: When you say approval template, is that the...
28:44 - Laura Dolphin: On an opportunity you have, what's the button name?
28:49 - Michael Kianmahd: Yes.
28:50 - Laura Dolphin: The submit for approval one?
28:52 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah, I think
28:53 - Laura Dolphin: so.
28:54 - Lyndon Elam: Yeah.
28:55 - Michael Kianmahd: So can you click on an opportunity that's actually closed and I'll
show you.
29:00 - Michael Kianmahd: Go to
29:01 - Laura Dolphin: something.
29:02 - Laura Dolphin: Yes.
29:03 - Laura Dolphin: Is decline sketch?
29:04 - Laura Dolphin: I'm just about Louis probably waiting.
29:07 - Laura Dolphin: But yeah, we can.
29:09 - Michael Kianmahd: Not declined.
29:12 - Laura Dolphin: Okay.
29:13 - Michael Kianmahd: Like an actual closed deal?
29:18 - Laura Dolphin: Sorry, close one?
29:20 - Michael Kianmahd: Yes.
29:20 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah, okay.
29:21 - Laura Dolphin: Here's one.
29:22 - Michael Kianmahd: And this is recent.
29:23 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah.
29:23 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah.
29:24 - Michael Kianmahd: Good.
29:24 - Michael Kianmahd: So scroll down.
29:27 - Michael Kianmahd: to activity
29:30 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah, there you go.
29:31 - Michael Kianmahd: And then look at the one that says approval.
29:35 - Michael Kianmahd: I find email that says approval or something like that.
29:39 - Laura Dolphin: I
29:41 - Michael Kianmahd: know
29:41 - Laura Dolphin: which one you're talking about.
29:42 - Laura Dolphin: I just don't know.
29:43 - Laura Dolphin: Is it the conditional?
29:45 - Michael Kianmahd: No.
29:46 - Michael Kianmahd: No.
29:47 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
29:48 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah.
29:50 - Michael Kianmahd: So I think from like a branding perspective, this could be im-
proved.
29:57 - Michael Kianmahd: So is this something like you can easily help us with?
30:01 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah, I've made quite a few amendments to these over the last six.
30:05 - Laura Dolphin: months they're not.
30:09 - Laura Dolphin: So your whole email thing, your whole email strategy is something
that I would probably do differently.
30:19 - Laura Dolphin: We are using a combination of like visual force email templates, which
this one is.
30:24 - Laura Dolphin: And then your automated ones that go on like your vehicles for like
insurance and stuff is done through like Apex, which.
30:34 - Laura Dolphin: could probably be done differently but yeah if this needs to be
amended we can do that
30:38 - Laura Dolphin: as like a, we can fix it.
30:41 - Lyndon Elam: Yeah.
30:41 - Michael Kianmahd: So I'll defer to you and Lynn on when is a good time to do that.
30:46 - Michael Kianmahd: Similar for insurance.
30:47 - Michael Kianmahd: And then Lynn, another idea that we can have is like we could do
automated email campaigns for customer service and collections.
30:55 - Lyndon Elam: Okay.
30:56 - Michael Kianmahd: We would need LeaseWorks data to basically...
31:00 - Michael Kianmahd: Hey.
31:02 - Michael Kianmahd: contribute as the source of data to determine when something's
actually delinquent and who should get the email.
31:08 - Lyndon Elam: But
31:09 - Michael Kianmahd: that's like to me pretty low hanging fruit and we're not doing that
right now.
31:13 - Lyndon Elam: Yeah.
31:14 - Lyndon Elam: Okay.
31:17 - Michael Kianmahd: Awesome.
31:17 - Michael Kianmahd: Thank you guys.
31:18 - Laura Dolphin: Great.
31:18 - Laura Dolphin: Thanks everyone.
31:19 - Laura Dolphin: Enjoy the rest of your day.
31:20 - Michael Kianmahd: You
31:20 - Lyndon Elam: too.
31:20 - Laura Dolphin: Bye-bye.
