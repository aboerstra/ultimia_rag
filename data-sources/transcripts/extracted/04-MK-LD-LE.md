Faye x Maxim Weekly Transcript
00:02 - Michael Kianmahd: I'm okay.
00:02 - Michael Kianmahd: How are you?
00:03 - Laura Dolphin: Good.
00:04 - Laura Dolphin: Cool background.
00:05 - Laura Dolphin: Is that art or is that background?
00:08 - Michael Kianmahd: It's real.
00:10 - Michael Kianmahd: I like it.
00:11 - Michael Kianmahd: I'm at a house before it closed on in the Hollywood Hills.
00:14 - Michael Kianmahd: So this is my view today.
00:16 - Laura Dolphin: Cool.
00:18 - Laura Dolphin: Well, no big deal.
00:20 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah, it's not bad.
00:22 - Michael Kianmahd: Worst deal I've ever done.
00:30 - Michael Kianmahd: Hey.
00:30 - Laura Dolphin: Hey.
00:31 - Laura Dolphin: All right, let's get into it.
00:35 - Laura Dolphin: I'm having issues with my Confluence, which is where I normally do
my notes.
00:39 - Laura Dolphin: So I've got just a screenshot of the hours, which I was going to embed
in the doc, and then only one agenda item, which is just like the intake.
00:50 - Laura Dolphin: staff.
00:50 - Laura Dolphin: I know Lynn, you're working on getting the answers to my questions.
00:54 - Laura Dolphin: If you have them, great, we can talk about them.
00:57 - Laura Dolphin: But I more so want to focus on like expectations around
01:03 - Laura Dolphin: like phasing that and how you want to work that with the data model
changes.
01:09 - Laura Dolphin: Do you
01:09 - Michael Kianmahd: want,
01:12 - Laura Dolphin: actually, I'll just, I'll share you, I'll share you this.
01:15 - Laura Dolphin: Apologies for the confluence.
01:16 - Laura Dolphin: It's literally just a snippet of the hours that I was going to put in there.
01:22 - Laura Dolphin: So, yeah, I was.
01:25 - Laura Dolphin: banking on going live and end of this month.
01:29 - Laura Dolphin: So I will be pulling probably a few things up for the engineer to work
on.
01:33 - Laura Dolphin: That being said, if you do have changes with the intake, there will likely
be changes that need to be made on the engineer and like the scoring side as well, if you're
wanting that to be part of that.
01:45 - Laura Dolphin: So I'll have to.
01:46 - Laura Dolphin: to hoping to have everything that by like today, if not tomorrow, so
that I can assign up some of those tasks we work on so that we can make sure that we're
using the hours.
01:57 - Laura Dolphin: This is where we're at.
01:58 - Laura Dolphin: This one is not.
02:01 - Laura Dolphin: accurate because there's been work on that today.
02:04 - Laura Dolphin: So that's underreported.
02:07 - Laura Dolphin: But yeah.
02:10 - Laura Dolphin: We're out for this month.
02:12 - Laura Dolphin: Questions?
02:15 - Laura Dolphin: It's just
02:15 - Lyndon Elam: broken
02:16 - Laura Dolphin: projects.
02:16 - Lyndon Elam: So if
02:17 - Laura Dolphin: you're not going to
02:18 - Lyndon Elam: access.
02:19 - Laura Dolphin: This is just hours.
02:20 - Laura Dolphin: It's just a screenshot.
02:21 - Laura Dolphin: Like I said before, the confluence where I normally keep my meeting
notes is it's down for us today.
02:27 - Laura Dolphin: So I can't actually like I don't have like an agenda.
02:30 - Laura Dolphin: So I just took a screenshot of the like where we track all of our hours.
02:35 - Laura Dolphin: Have you not seen one of these before?
02:37 - Laura Dolphin: I've shown these to Michael.
02:38 - Laura Dolphin: You might not have been on.
02:39 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah, it's just like a breakdown of the hours for this month by project.
02:42 - Lyndon Elam: Okay.
02:43 - Lyndon Elam: Got
02:44 - Laura Dolphin: it.
02:44 - Laura Dolphin: Just so you can kind of like stay on top of that.
02:46 - Laura Dolphin: So,
02:47 - Lyndon Elam: okay.
02:49 - Lyndon Elam: I do not have answers on the questions yet.
02:52 - Lyndon Elam: I will get those to you today.
02:57 - Lyndon Elam: Yeah.
03:00 - Laura Dolphin: That's okay.
03:01 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah, let me know.
03:02 - Laura Dolphin: So I guess my question then back to you guys is, are you wanting us
to...
03:06 - Laura Dolphin: to like hold off and incorporate those into the data model and then
release it all?
03:13 - Laura Dolphin: Or do you want to push forward with what we have for the data model
and then work on those changes in the background and then do that as like a little mini phase
two?
03:25 - Lyndon Elam: My gut would be to hold off unless there's something that is...
03:32 - Lyndon Elam: dependent on the data model.
03:38 - Laura Dolphin: I mean, there are dependencies.
03:40 - Laura Dolphin: So like your new scoring models, for example, can't go live without
that.
03:45 - Laura Dolphin: But if they're not useful to you without having the data model
represented the way that you have it with your changes.
03:53 - Laura Dolphin: then I would say it's kind of pointless.
03:56 - Laura Dolphin: There is additional work to be done.
03:58 - Laura Dolphin: So whether or not we deploy.
04:01 - Laura Dolphin: and then kind of like work on it in the background.
04:06 - Laura Dolphin: or do it all at the same time, like there still needs to be work to be done.
04:12 - Laura Dolphin: The downside is that you won't have.
04:16 - Laura Dolphin: all of like, I guess you just won't have all of like the new features and
stuff that are with the data model.
04:21 - Laura Dolphin: So it's ultimately, it's up to you.
04:23 - Laura Dolphin: There's not much that.
04:26 - Laura Dolphin: is really waiting on it other than other work, right?
04:29 - Laura Dolphin: Like, so the approval process, we can't start on until we have that.
04:33 - Laura Dolphin: We will really just be like focusing on the changes there.
04:35 - Laura Dolphin: So.
04:37 - Laura Dolphin: I'll let you make the decision.
04:39 - Lyndon Elam: Yeah, I think.
04:43 - Michael Kianmahd: Sorry, are we making data model changes as a result of the
updated process map that we came up
04:49 - Laura Dolphin: with?
04:50 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah, so there's a few, namely adding in another record type, the
promissory note.
04:58 - Laura Dolphin: contract type.
05:00 - Laura Dolphin: We'll need to have some work.
05:03 - Laura Dolphin: There was scoring, being able to score on the other record type.
05:08 - Laura Dolphin: Let me just pull it up.
05:11 - Laura Dolphin: There was one more.
05:15 - Laura Dolphin: Oh, and then I don't have the answers, so I can't fully advise, but my
gut tells me that.
05:20 - Laura Dolphin: like the referral source point of contact and then that lead source there
might be a couple changes there mostly the changes are going to be in the actual intake flow
as well so I'll need to like kind of shift that around
05:37 - Laura Dolphin: I think those are the only...
05:39 - Michael Kianmahd: ones.
05:40 - Laura Dolphin: It just means that when we do those changes, we have to sort of like
retest.
05:45 - Laura Dolphin: have to get the engineer to like retest the score and can and alt might
have to like update their stuff as well so they're little but they are there definitely changes in
there
05:59 - Michael Kianmahd: Okay, so what I captured was.
06:03 - Michael Kianmahd: Sorry for the alarm.
06:05 - Michael Kianmahd: They're just doing alarm work here.
06:06 - Laura Dolphin: Okay,
06:08 - Michael Kianmahd: I can only hear.
06:09 - Michael Kianmahd: Okay, good.
06:12 - Michael Kianmahd: So I think we could push through without other being in place.
06:15 - Michael Kianmahd: I don't think it's going to impact anything.
06:18 - Michael Kianmahd: So I think we're okay to do that.
06:24 - Michael Kianmahd: Collateral type other.
06:25 - Michael Kianmahd: Is that ready to go?
06:27 - Laura Dolphin: That's the one.
06:28 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
06:28 - Laura Dolphin: So no, that is essentially that's just a field on the collateral.
06:35 - Laura Dolphin: I can add that in pretty easily.
06:38 - Michael Kianmahd: The
06:38 - Laura Dolphin: thing is, it's just if you need that, I don't think you do.
06:41 - Laura Dolphin: do need it considered at all in terms of scoring or anything because
we're not
06:47 - Laura Dolphin: Sorry, let me rephrase that.
06:51 - Laura Dolphin: So we are only sending for scoring titled and non-titled collateral.
06:59 - Laura Dolphin: We are not sending real estate and we are not sending other.
07:02 - Laura Dolphin: Do you need those sent?
07:06 - Laura Dolphin: No,
07:06 - Michael Kianmahd: I don't think we needed scent, but...
07:12 - Michael Kianmahd: If we could take a step back for a second, I just want to make
sure I understand.
07:16 - Michael Kianmahd: So the collateral object is a custom object, correct?
07:20 - Laura Dolphin: It's just vehicles renamed, but yes, it's custom object.
07:23 - Michael Kianmahd: Okay.
07:24 - Michael Kianmahd: And then are we going to have collateral record
07:26 - Laura Dolphin: types?
07:27 - Laura Dolphin: Yes.
07:27 - Laura Dolphin: So that's your titled, non-titled, real estate and other.
07:32 - Laura Dolphin: And your other is like how we always spoke about it as like a bar of
gold.
07:37 - Laura Dolphin: But that's where that pick list will go, where you'll be able to select
from the list.
07:41 - Laura Dolphin: So it's like aviation, gym equipment, whatever.
07:44 - Laura Dolphin: Okay.
07:44 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah.
07:48 - Michael Kianmahd: Lynn, tell me what you think about this.
07:49 - Michael Kianmahd: but
07:51 - Michael Kianmahd: I imagine the way you're sending data for scoring is in a JSON
or something like that, right?
07:59 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah, it's in JSON format, correct.
08:01 - Michael Kianmahd: Okay.
08:02 - Michael Kianmahd: So if we say, yeah, let's also be able to send other.
08:09 - Michael Kianmahd: and it's just in json format and it just doesn't go anywhere will it
break anything
08:17 - Laura Dolphin: Well, why would you send it if you're not going to do anything with it?
08:21 - Michael Kianmahd: Like, let's say we're looking at like a medical deal and we want
we want to run it through the scoring model.
08:26 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
08:27 - Michael Kianmahd: Does that break anything if we do that?
08:29 - Laura Dolphin: I would have to ask, um, I'll score and can, I honestly have no idea.
08:33 - Laura Dolphin: Um, I know that if we, so I know that we have broken, like, so basically
it doesn't work.
08:39 - Laura Dolphin: if we have values in there that like don't map or don't exist or anything
like that.
08:48 - Laura Dolphin: But I would ask, can they might not be able to like receive it, right?
08:52 - Laura Dolphin: So we can build it if you want to.
08:56 - Michael Kianmahd: We don't need it.
08:57 - Michael Kianmahd: So I would say.
08:59 - Michael Kianmahd: Hey.
09:03 - Michael Kianmahd: I think the only I'm asking, because if we do a structured financing
deal and there is collateral type other and we want to run it through the scoring model, I don't
want it to break.
09:15 - Michael Kianmahd: That's the scenario that I'm thinking about.
09:17 - Michael Kianmahd: So if you do a deal, there's equipment, real estate, and then we
take some other gold bar or whatever, and it's in Salesforce, and that gets pushed to the
scoring model.
09:28 - Michael Kianmahd: I don't want that to trigger some sort of error.
09:31 - Laura Dolphin: It shouldn't.
09:33 - Laura Dolphin: We already have the other collateral record type available today.
09:37 - Michael Kianmahd: Great.
09:38 - Michael Kianmahd: Okay.
09:38 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
09:39 - Laura Dolphin: So it should be fine.
09:39 - Laura Dolphin: That one's simply just adding a pick list.
09:42 - Laura Dolphin: That one's pretty straightforward.
09:44 - Laura Dolphin: Unless you, you know, the difficult part would be if you wanted to start
sending that and utilizing that.
09:50 - Laura Dolphin: pick list to do scoring.
09:51 - Laura Dolphin: But if you don't, then it's a really easy change.
09:55 - Michael Kianmahd: Okay, so...
09:59 - Michael Kianmahd: Why wouldn't we, what exactly is the holdup then?
10:02 - Michael Kianmahd: Because just from what you're sharing, it sounds like that
component, which was.
10:07 - Michael Kianmahd: I think the biggest change.
10:10 - Michael Kianmahd: I don't think we should hold it up over opportunity records either.
10:14 - Michael Kianmahd: I think that could be a phase two thing.
10:16 - Laura Dolphin: Sure.
10:17 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah, that's fine.
10:18 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah.
10:19 - Michael Kianmahd: And then what other sort of decision points are there that would?
10:24 - Michael Kianmahd: slow down our ability to deliver.
10:27 - Laura Dolphin: I mean, like I said, I don't have the answers to the questions, so I can't
fully
10:31 - Michael Kianmahd: say.
10:32 - Michael Kianmahd: So what are the questions?
10:33 - Michael Kianmahd: Let's try to get answers.
10:36 - Laura Dolphin: Well, Lynn, do you want to discuss or do you feel like you don't have
the answers and it would be relevant to just wait?
10:43 - Lyndon Elam: No, we can discuss.
10:47 - Lyndon Elam: So...
10:47 - Lyndon Elam: So...
10:47 - Lyndon Elam: So...
10:49 - Lyndon Elam: By a lead source, do you mean lead source on the opportunity rather
than the contact?
10:57 - Lyndon Elam: So I'm not...
10:59 - Lyndon Elam: I think.
11:02 - Lyndon Elam: I think of LeadSource as the channel.
11:05 - Lyndon Elam: which is going to be
11:06 - Lyndon Elam: E.
11:06 - Lyndon Elam: E.
11:09 - Lyndon Elam: at the opportunities would align with.
11:13 - Lyndon Elam: Lead source that way.
11:20 - Lyndon Elam: But context, I mean, I'm not sure, I don't understand the rather than.
11:24 - Lyndon Elam: Ahem.
11:26 - Lyndon Elam: So, how do we
11:27 - Laura Dolphin: understand?
11:28 - Laura Dolphin: So, lead source is a standard field that exists on leads, contacts, and
opportunities in Salesforce.
11:34 - Laura Dolphin: It's a pick list.
11:35 - Laura Dolphin: So there are predefined values in there.
11:38 - Laura Dolphin: You guys have on opportunities, I think it's just TR, but I could be
wrong.
11:45 - Laura Dolphin: You do have certain validations that run in that say like, oh, the broker
is currency capital, therefore the lead source has to be direct or whatever it is.
11:56 - Laura Dolphin: right so it's not just setting that like you can't just create new values
and set the lead source into that existing field without considering
12:05 - Laura Dolphin: how the logic works on any existing things like that so when I said are
you talking so the reason I asked about the lead source on opportunity rather than contact
is because your 1a in your email said add a step before contact record step to record lead
source I assumed you meant when you said
12:25 - Laura Dolphin: the contact record i'm assuming meant the entry points right
12:29 - Laura Dolphin: I assume that's what you meant.
12:32 - Laura Dolphin: And actually,
12:34 - Lyndon Elam: wherever that flow started.
12:35 - Laura Dolphin: Yes.
12:35 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
12:36 - Laura Dolphin: So the entry points.
12:36 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
12:37 - Laura Dolphin: So basically, I believe what you're asking for here is to almost say, like,
ask the first thing that you ask the user when they start the intake is like, what is the source
of this deal?
12:46 - Laura Dolphin: Is it a broker, direct vendor or other?
12:49 - Laura Dolphin: Right.
12:50 - Laura Dolphin: So if it's a broker, we go down the, okay, we're going to like the referral
source contact is a broker.
12:56 - Laura Dolphin: if it's a vendor, the referral source contact is a vendor.
13:00 - Laura Dolphin: If it's direct, one of the questions was like, what do you mean by this?
13:05 - Laura Dolphin: Is this your title loan cash out, which we are changing to just cash
out?
13:10 - Laura Dolphin: And then where does the other go?
13:12 - Laura Dolphin: So I don't fully understand.
13:14 - Laura Dolphin: I'd love to actually just hear the explanation.
13:17 - Laura Dolphin: of one A and one B spoken out loud so that I can kind of try and
understand and translate it into.
13:25 - Laura Dolphin: the actual like terminology of the system and like the processes and
stuff
13:31 - Michael Kianmahd: Sorry, would it help if we look at the map together and we try to
show you visually?
13:35 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah,
13:36 - Laura Dolphin: yeah, yeah.
13:37 - Laura Dolphin: If you if you want to do that.
13:39 - Laura Dolphin: Do you want my document or do you prefer yours?
13:42 - Michael Kianmahd: If you could pull up your document, we
13:44 - Laura Dolphin: could probably
13:45 - Michael Kianmahd: talk you through
13:46 - Laura Dolphin: it.
13:46 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
13:48 - Laura Dolphin: Give me a sec here.
13:52 - Laura Dolphin: And we want the future one,
13:55 - Michael Kianmahd: right?
13:56 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah.
13:56 - Laura Dolphin: Okay.
13:57 - Laura Dolphin: So just keep in mind, I started to try and kind of like.
14:01 - Laura Dolphin: lay across what you were asking for and then just stopped when I got
to the questions.
14:08 - Laura Dolphin: So here's your entry.
14:10 - Laura Dolphin: So you have entry one and then your entry two.
14:12 - Laura Dolphin: And then I think what you're asking for is kind of like.
14:16 - Laura Dolphin: a third entry which we actually have and we don't use anymore
because
14:23 - Laura Dolphin: Systematically, it adds quite a few steps for the user.
14:27 - Laura Dolphin: So Louie and I decided that we were going to skip that.
14:32 - Laura Dolphin: and just do the entries from the broker or the vendors.
14:36 - Laura Dolphin: but we can add that back.
14:37 - Laura Dolphin: So I think that's what you're asking for, where you're kind of like.
14:41 - Laura Dolphin: you might not know or the broker or vendor don't exist in the system
and you almost want to just say to the user like,
14:47 - Laura Dolphin: what's the source of this intake um and then they're going to go
through a list so broker vendor easy i kind of get that right it's going to go down like this
came from a broker therefore we're
14:59 - Michael Kianmahd: going to like
15:00 - Laura Dolphin: assign the broker as the referral source contact i believe
15:03 - Laura Dolphin: and then it would be like vendor would be referral source contact.
15:06 - Laura Dolphin: I don't understand what you mean when they select direct and when
they select other.
15:13 - Laura Dolphin: So like direct is typically used for title loans or that common use case
that we that I brought up a couple weeks ago where it's like when Fernando.
15:23 - Laura Dolphin: submits a deal and he is like the referral source contractor on behalf
of like Maximar Currency Capital.
15:31 - Michael Kianmahd: Okay, let's take a step back.
15:37 - Michael Kianmahd: The workflow that we saw does not include.
15:43 - Michael Kianmahd: When a client applies directly to us and there's no broker.
15:48 - Michael Kianmahd: or dealer submitting the deal directly to us.
15:53 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah.
15:54 - Michael Kianmahd: We want to solve for when there is still a referral source contact.
16:00 - Michael Kianmahd: but it's not a broker, vendor, or direct.
16:03 - Michael Kianmahd: It could be some other category like a lawyer, an accountant.
16:08 - Michael Kianmahd: a friend of a friend, that kind of thing.
16:11 - Michael Kianmahd: That's the other.
16:12 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah, that's the
16:13 - Laura Dolphin: other.
16:13 - Michael Kianmahd: So we just need a parking spot for everybody who isn't direct
broker vendor.
16:20 - Laura Dolphin: Okay.
16:21 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah.
16:22 - Michael Kianmahd: And I recall an earlier conversation when we were talking about
this account record types.
16:28 - Michael Kianmahd: We had a count record type.
16:32 - Michael Kianmahd: and we talked about referral sources that were not vendors or
brokers, I don't remember what we selected, but if we selected another type of account
record type,
16:41 - Michael Kianmahd: that is a deal referral source who is not a broker or vendor, let's
call it that.
16:49 - Laura Dolphin: It's just service with service providers is the category for those
16:52 - Michael Kianmahd: guys.
16:53 - Michael Kianmahd: Service provider was not a referral source contact.
16:55 - Michael Kianmahd: Service provider was.
16:58 - Laura Dolphin: Oh, I'm sorry.
16:59 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah, you do have a list of account types that are not like...
17:04 - Laura Dolphin: brokers but they are in the referrals yeah sorry you're correct
17:08 - Michael Kianmahd: okay so like if it's other
17:13 - Michael Kianmahd: then the choices are
17:15 - Michael Kianmahd: those other categories that we may have seen a deal from.
17:20 - Laura Dolphin: Can it be a vendor or referral source contact though, or is it both?
17:25 - Laura Dolphin: Sorry, can it be either or is it only?
17:30 - Laura Dolphin: One of them.
17:31 - Michael Kianmahd: You're not going to see the deal.
17:34 - Michael Kianmahd: Like you're not going to get a referral from more than one of these
categories.
17:40 - Michael Kianmahd: You're only going to get a referral from one of these categories.
17:43 - Michael Kianmahd: So it's either going to come through a broker or a vendor.
17:48 - Michael Kianmahd: or it's going to come direct, or it's going to come from another
source, like a lawyer, accountant.
17:55 - Laura Dolphin: Sorry, let me ask that a different way.
17:56 - Laura Dolphin: If it comes from one of those other, like a lawyer or an accountant.
18:00 - Laura Dolphin: can they be?
18:01 - Laura Dolphin: E.
18:03 - Laura Dolphin: Are they a referral partner or could they be technically in the vendor
categories?
18:11 - Michael Kianmahd: They are not in a vendor
18:12 - Laura Dolphin: category.
18:13 - Laura Dolphin: Okay, perfect.
18:14 - Laura Dolphin: So then it's just other referral.
18:15 - Laura Dolphin: Okay,
18:15 - Michael Kianmahd: that makes sense.
18:16 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah.
18:16 - Michael Kianmahd: So it's like, it could be like a realtor.
18:21 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah.
18:21 - Michael Kianmahd: We met somewhere that for whatever reason is in our system.
18:25 - Michael Kianmahd: and they have a client that needs a hard money loan and they
make an introduction.
18:29 - Michael Kianmahd: I think we want to track that information.
18:31 - Laura Dolphin: Okay.
18:31 - Laura Dolphin: Yep.
18:32 - Laura Dolphin: Yep.
18:33 - Laura Dolphin: Understood.
18:34 - Laura Dolphin: Okay.
18:34 - Laura Dolphin: So if they select other, then they're basically saying like, what type is
it?
18:39 - Laura Dolphin: And we would just.
18:40 - Laura Dolphin: show the different account types that are available for referral source
and they would say like it's a lawyer and then they could go and like search out the account
if it's best then it yeah okay
18:49 - Michael Kianmahd: that's fine
18:51 - Laura Dolphin: Okay, so the direct flow.
18:55 - Laura Dolphin: We started to talk about this a couple weeks ago.
18:57 - Laura Dolphin: If you remember, I brought it up because Louie brought it up with me
and said, like, we don't know how to handle this in Salesforce.
19:04 - Laura Dolphin: So if they.
19:05 - Laura Dolphin: Hey.
19:07 - Laura Dolphin: If it is a direct deal and the customer comes to us, who is the referral
source contact?
19:14 - Michael Kianmahd: Nobody.
19:24 - Laura Dolphin: No broker then?
19:27 - Michael Kianmahd: If a customer applied directly on our website and there's no
broker or vendor involved that referred the deal, then nobody.
19:35 - Lyndon Elam: It's truly a direct channel.
19:37 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah.
19:38 - Laura Dolphin: Okay.
19:40 - Laura Dolphin: And then is it still applicable then if they get to the point when they...
19:43 - Laura Dolphin: They go down heavy equipment, then they will select a vendor.
19:50 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah, that's a nuance, right?
19:53 - Michael Kianmahd: So the nuance is...
19:55 - Michael Kianmahd: Who's referring the deal?
19:59 - Michael Kianmahd: right so if it's a vendor referred deal and the vendor is the seller
of the equipment
20:05 - Michael Kianmahd: Those two names are going to be the same.
20:08 - Michael Kianmahd: but if it's a direct deal and the guy's shopping for equipment and
randomly selects a vendor
20:14 - Michael Kianmahd: We're not seeing the deal from the vendor.
20:17 - Michael Kianmahd: The customer applied directly, sent us the invoice from their
preferred vendor.
20:22 - Michael Kianmahd: We're working the deal directly.
20:23 - Michael Kianmahd: And then we still capture the vendor information down the chain.
20:28 - Michael Kianmahd: in stage six, I think, right?
20:32 - Laura Dolphin: Sorry, stage five.
20:35 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
20:35 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
20:36 - Michael Kianmahd: So that doesn't mean that that vendor filled in in stage five is the
referral source.
20:41 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah.
20:42 - Michael Kianmahd: You're still capturing who the vendor is and who we're paying.
20:46 - Michael Kianmahd: when we finance the equipment for that directly originated deal.
20:50 - Laura Dolphin: Okay, that makes sense.
20:51 - Laura Dolphin: So then what I...
20:54 - Laura Dolphin: What I feel like is not covered here is that cash out title loan.
20:59 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah, old words.
21:01 - Michael Kianmahd: That's an old concept.
21:03 - Laura Dolphin: So is direct the new term?
21:07 - Michael Kianmahd: No, because you could do a title loan and it could be broker
originated.
21:10 - Michael Kianmahd: So we're mixing old world Maxim language and future Maxim
language.
21:17 - Michael Kianmahd: So if we provide a customer a loan against equipment, whether
it's titled or non-titled,
21:26 - Michael Kianmahd: It could be broker originated.
21:29 - Michael Kianmahd: It could be direct.
21:30 - Michael Kianmahd: It could be other.
21:33 - Michael Kianmahd: I don't think that's a determinant factor.
21:35 - Michael Kianmahd: So like when I looked at like the intake.
21:40 - Michael Kianmahd: form that Louie was operating last week, I noticed this recurring
circular question that kept getting asked.
21:48 - Michael Kianmahd: And that's what triggered the thought to process map this,
because it looked like we were asking questions that will no longer be relevant in the future
state.
21:56 - Laura Dolphin: Okay, so sorry, I got distracted when you were first talking because
my Chrome decided to...
22:02 - Laura Dolphin: refresh.
22:03 - Laura Dolphin: I'll bring this back up.
22:05 - Laura Dolphin: But so
22:05 - Laura Dolphin: So
22:09 - Laura Dolphin: There.
22:11 - Laura Dolphin: Sorry.
22:11 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah, I missed the first part of this where you actually
22:14 - Michael Kianmahd: address the question.
22:15 - Michael Kianmahd: You used the word title loan, right?
22:17 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
22:17 - Laura Dolphin: So yesterday on the call or two days ago on the call, you said that title
loan is going away and it's going to be replaced with cash out.
22:24 - Laura Dolphin: That's what you had said on the steering committee.
22:27 - Laura Dolphin: but are those not synonymous with direct like are those
22:32 - Michael Kianmahd: the
22:32 - Laura Dolphin: same thing
22:33 - Michael Kianmahd: No.
22:34 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah.
22:34 - Michael Kianmahd: So you could do a cash out, but it could be a broker originated
deal.
22:42 - Laura Dolphin: Okay, so then we are missing something in the automation here that
tells us.
22:48 - Laura Dolphin: Which one is it?
22:49 - Laura Dolphin: This one here.
22:50 - Laura Dolphin: So when they go down structured financing and then they select cash
out.
22:54 - Laura Dolphin: that's our trigger for that flow, right?
22:58 - Laura Dolphin: That's right here.
23:00 - Laura Dolphin: When they go down structured financing, is it just
23:02 - Lyndon Elam: cash
23:02 - Laura Dolphin: out that goes our?
23:04 - Laura Dolphin: The reason that that is important, like I said on Monday, is because
you guys have ties in your system today, specifically Leaseworks.
23:11 - Laura Dolphin: where you need to have a specific account in the vendor relationship
and a dealer relationship on an opportunity.
23:18 - Laura Dolphin: Because if you don't, then the resource integration will fail.
23:23 - Laura Dolphin: because it needs that vendor number that gets generated from
Salesforce.
23:27 - Laura Dolphin: Whether it needs to still be like that, I don't know.
23:31 - Laura Dolphin: That's a separate conversation.
23:32 - Laura Dolphin: I have asked finance, like, do you know why you actually need this
number in Leaseworks?
23:37 - Laura Dolphin: And they have said, no, they just know that they do.
23:42 - Michael Kianmahd: Okay, so I would challenge that next time I had that conversation
with them because then that.
23:48 - Michael Kianmahd: If we're lending money against equipment,
23:51 - Michael Kianmahd: whether or not there's a broker involved or it's a direct originated
deal.
23:56 - Michael Kianmahd: And there's no vendor involved.
23:59 - Michael Kianmahd: If it's some sort of integration, like if a blank gets shot over and
a blank causes an error, then we should build functionality that when a blank goes over, it
doesn't cause an error.
24:11 - Laura Dolphin: I completely agree.
24:13 - Laura Dolphin: This is one of those things that if you remember, I called out like early
on and I said, what are these vendor dealer numbers doing?
24:20 - Laura Dolphin: And we made a consensus that like we don't actually need them.
24:24 - Laura Dolphin: And so I made them inactive.
24:25 - Laura Dolphin: And then accounting was like, hang on, we need this.
24:28 - Laura Dolphin: We need this.
24:29 - Laura Dolphin: And I asked why, and they didn't know why.
24:30 - Laura Dolphin: They just know that we needed it.
24:32 - Laura Dolphin: Do you
24:32 - Lyndon Elam: remember that?
24:33 - Lyndon Elam: Laura, for what type of?
24:35 - Lyndon Elam: or what submission types is that required for?
24:38 - Laura Dolphin: So it's currently today, it's called a title loan deal.
24:43 - Laura Dolphin: And a title loan is essentially what I understand and what I've heard
the same as a cash out.
24:48 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah.
24:49 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
24:49 - Laura Dolphin: So we're going to rename title loan to cash out.
24:53 - Laura Dolphin: But what that is, is like there is no...
24:57 - Laura Dolphin: dealer.
24:58 - Laura Dolphin: There is often a broker.
25:01 - Laura Dolphin: From what I've understood, like 95% of the time there is a broker.
25:04 - Laura Dolphin: There is no vendor, but the way that we're handling in a system is
that there's an account called title loan that gets associated so that we can pull that vendor
number for leaseworks.
25:16 - Laura Dolphin: Again, whether or not we need that in Leaseworks, I don't know.
25:18 - Laura Dolphin: I'm happy to remove it from the integration, but it seems like we need
to get a grip on why and how within Leaseworks we are using vendor numbers and whether
we actually need it because I would love to get rid of that account.
25:32 - Laura Dolphin: Does that make sense, Lynn?
25:34 - Lyndon Elam: Yeah.
25:38 - Michael Kianmahd: Laura, do you have a hard stop at 11?
25:40 - Laura Dolphin: I do.
25:40 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah, we're going over the docs with Juan.
25:42 - Laura Dolphin: I did.
25:44 - Laura Dolphin: I can go over a couple of minutes because I made the other host
organizer, but.
25:49 - Michael Kianmahd: yeah I'm gonna if it's okay with you I'm gonna push off the
deferment meeting half an hour
25:55 - Lyndon Elam: Sure.
25:55 - Michael Kianmahd: I may have to do that remotely.
25:57 - Michael Kianmahd: I think I prefer to do that in the afternoon.
25:58 - Michael Kianmahd: Would that be okay with you?
26:00 - Lyndon Elam: Yeah.
26:01 - Michael Kianmahd: Okay.
26:02 - Michael Kianmahd: Can we push off the...
26:03 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah.
26:04 - Michael Kianmahd: The 1230 meeting to another day.
26:12 - Lyndon Elam: Yes.
26:13 - Michael Kianmahd: Okay, so I'm going to do this deferment meeting at one o'clock.
26:23 - Michael Kianmahd: And that'll give me time hopefully to get back.
26:28 - Michael Kianmahd: Okay.
26:32 - Michael Kianmahd: Laura, it's like...
26:36 - Michael Kianmahd: I could be wrong.
26:38 - Michael Kianmahd: So I get that we have like residual technical debt that needs to
be clarified.
26:45 - Michael Kianmahd: I feel like we're trying to push into the future, but we still get pulled
back and how it is today.
26:50 - Michael Kianmahd: And we're like,
26:51 - Michael Kianmahd: well we can't do this because that's how it's done today we could
still fix that right
26:56 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah, absolutely.
26:57 - Michael Kianmahd: Okay.
26:58 - Laura Dolphin: So
26:58 - Michael Kianmahd: I'm
26:59 - Laura Dolphin: pushing for, but it seems to be that.
27:02 - Laura Dolphin: the group there's a lack of like the knowledge of the whys and the
hows and when decisions get made it seems to be without a full understanding of like what's
why it's used or how it's used so
27:16 - Michael Kianmahd: So
27:16 - Laura Dolphin: I feel like we're at a good place now to just challenge these with a little
bit more knowledge.
27:21 - Laura Dolphin: But that has been what's happened is all, you know, say like, why is
this used or why?
27:26 - Laura Dolphin: And
27:26 - Michael Kianmahd: they say,
27:26 - Laura Dolphin: no,
27:26 - Michael Kianmahd: that.
27:27 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah.
27:28 - Michael Kianmahd: So first of all, that is an incredibly astute observation that you
just made.
27:31 - Michael Kianmahd: And it's been the bane of my existence.
27:33 - Michael Kianmahd: OK.
27:34 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah.
27:34 - Michael Kianmahd: Okay.
27:35 - Michael Kianmahd: So my only solution to that is to centralize all this information,
which then creates a.
27:41 - Michael Kianmahd: a time consumption that's not sustainable on me or the person
who's responsible for centralizing that information because not everybody understands how
everything ties.
27:50 - Michael Kianmahd: So Lynn, I think you should take responsibility for that.
27:57 - Michael Kianmahd: I will be involved because there's contacts that I have.
28:01 - Michael Kianmahd: Laura, I think you should take technical responsibility for
28:04 - Laura Dolphin: that.
28:05 - Michael Kianmahd: And if you need to push finance or you need to push operations
or you need to push somebody to get answers you need and you need Lynn or I on that call
to provide context or say yes or no or short circuit conversations, let us know.
28:19 - Michael Kianmahd: But the way this should function in the future is if there's no
vendor.
28:25 - Michael Kianmahd: but Leaseworks requires a vendor, we should build the technol-
ogy so if you shoot a blank, it doesn't break the booking tool.
28:34 - Michael Kianmahd: I imagine it has to do with the booking tool.
28:37 - Laura Dolphin: So that's the whole thing is I can do whatever I want with the
integration.
28:41 - Laura Dolphin: I just don't know the requirements in finance on Leaseworks and the
ins and outs of how that works.
28:46 - Laura Dolphin: So I don't want to break an integration.
28:49 - Laura Dolphin: And then you realize in six months time, you are missing things that
you needed critically for reporting.
28:56 - Laura Dolphin: And so, yeah, Lynn, I feel like you're you've proven already that you're
like.
29:02 - Laura Dolphin: This is your area.
29:03 - Laura Dolphin: You're great at this.
29:06 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah, I feel like you can handle this between us.
29:09 - Laura Dolphin: I now have you and you can rally the team on your end and you and
I can sort these things.
29:16 - Lyndon Elam: Yep.
29:20 - Michael Kianmahd: yeah
29:20 - Lyndon Elam: if
29:20 - Michael Kianmahd: i could be helpful let me know because i tend to have context
29:25 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah, yeah, definitely.
29:28 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah, I mean, I will reach out when I have questions.
29:31 - Laura Dolphin: This is one of them.
29:33 - Laura Dolphin: So I guess from this point, what I would like to understand.
29:38 - Laura Dolphin: From a financial perspective, whoever the business owner is of
LeaseWorks, I'm assuming that's Jacob.
29:44 - Laura Dolphin: is to get a better understanding of the vendor number.
29:49 - Laura Dolphin: and why and how we need them specifically for direct deals.
29:55 - Laura Dolphin: and whether or not that is a requirement.
29:57 - Laura Dolphin: If you can get me that information, then I can come back to you and
say, okay, this is what we will do within the systems in the process to accommodate that.
30:06 - Lyndon Elam: I've got that.
30:08 - Lyndon Elam: I had it recorded as for title loan deals instead of direct deals, but I think
I understand what you
30:12 - Laura Dolphin: mean.
30:13 - Laura Dolphin: They're like all of them.
30:14 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
30:14 - Laura Dolphin: So direct title loans, cash out.
30:16 - Laura Dolphin: I would literally just put all of those names because terminology tends
to.
30:22 - Laura Dolphin: be an issue for a lot of different people, myself included.
30:26 - Laura Dolphin: Someone might hear something and not equate it to what they have
in their head.
30:30 - Laura Dolphin: So I feel like
30:31 - Lyndon Elam: if you
30:31 - Laura Dolphin: just include all of those, we can get a good, clear, concise answer on
that business process.
30:37 - Laura Dolphin: Once I have that, then I can understand a little bit better how to
structure the systems and process to accommodate those requirements.
30:45 - Laura Dolphin: So yeah, that'd be great.
30:47 - Laura Dolphin: And then this, sorry, just moving this along.
30:48 - Laura Dolphin: The second question that I had was around changing the referral
source to point of contact.
30:55 - Laura Dolphin: So did you mean, so first off, there's a few places where referral
contact is utilized.
31:02 - Laura Dolphin: The first is on.
31:05 - Laura Dolphin: accounts and contacts, it's actually the name of the record types.
31:09 - Laura Dolphin: Right.
31:09 - Laura Dolphin: So we've got like referral, referral source as accounts, which are
brokers, lawyers, things like that.
31:16 - Laura Dolphin: We've got referral source contacts on contacts that are associated
to those types of accounts.
31:21 - Laura Dolphin: We've got a field on opportunities, referral source contact that is used
in so many different places that.
31:30 - Laura Dolphin: highlights that source, right?
31:32 - Laura Dolphin: Like who's that original source, the broker, the vendor contact.
31:35 - Laura Dolphin: And then we also have opportunity contact roles with the role of
referral source contact.
31:41 - Laura Dolphin: Those are duplicative.
31:45 - Laura Dolphin: duplicated of the referral source contact, but you can have multiple,
right?
31:49 - Laura Dolphin: So the idea is to switch away from the field on opportunities and
eventually just use opportunity contact goals.
31:56 - Laura Dolphin: Those are used in AIO.
31:57 - Lyndon Elam: So let me explain what the requirement was.
32:03 - Lyndon Elam: This was truly just like housekeeping.
32:06 - Lyndon Elam: This is like sweeping the floor.
32:09 - Lyndon Elam: And the sweeping was, huh.
32:12 - Lyndon Elam: We get a little bit confused when we talk about a referral source
contact.
32:17 - Lyndon Elam: In reality, what we mean is that that person is the point of contact for
the opportunity.
32:23 - Lyndon Elam: So rather than referring to it as a referral source contact,
32:27 - Lyndon Elam: Can we just relabel the...
32:29 - Lyndon Elam: the field description within Salesforce to point of contact.
32:34 - Laura Dolphin: So that's where I'm going to push back and say there's four places.
32:39 - Laura Dolphin: Which one do you want?
32:40 - Laura Dolphin: All of them?
32:44 - Lyndon Elam: I think if that's the label that is used and it's the same field across four
different objects.
32:51 - Lyndon Elam: then yes, to change that.
32:54 - Lyndon Elam: If that's...
32:56 - Lyndon Elam: a crap ton of work, this is not material.
33:00 - Lyndon Elam: This adds zero business value.
33:02 - Lyndon Elam: So if it's as cosmetic as, let me go in and update, right?
33:09 - Lyndon Elam: the field description or the object descriptor name.
33:14 - Lyndon Elam: Perfect.
33:15 - Lyndon Elam: Let's make that change.
33:17 - Lyndon Elam: If there's more complex things that come out of this and it impacts any
sort of logic,
33:21 - Lyndon Elam: I have no issue going back to the team and saying, tough, we're sticking
with referral source, get used to it.
33:28 - Laura Dolphin: Okay.
33:29 - Laura Dolphin: I mean, I can, yeah, I would probably do that as a phase two if I was.
33:34 - Laura Dolphin: I don't want to like do something and then realize later down the road
that it does impact something.
33:39 - Laura Dolphin: I'm 90% confident that it doesn't, but because it's used in so many
places, I'd rather not touch it if we don't have to.
33:48 - Lyndon Elam: Well, and let me ask this.
33:50 - Lyndon Elam: Will the columns in our data extracts, etc., continue to refer to referral
source?
33:59 - Lyndon Elam: in which case anyone who runs an extract is going to be confused and
say, well, no, no, I was supposed to include the point of contact.
34:08 - Lyndon Elam: If that's the case and that's going to be a lingering thing, I don't think
it's worth it to make this change.
34:12 - Lyndon Elam: Like this, this was truly like somebody sweeping up and saying, you
know.
34:17 - Lyndon Elam: While we're making all these other changes, it might clear things up if
we refer to this as a point of contact rather than a referral source.
34:24 - Laura Dolphin: So if you do it now or if you do it in the future, it doesn't matter.
34:28 - Laura Dolphin: There are ways like, well, I'll update the data.
34:32 - Laura Dolphin: Most of that, like we're introducing the new record type.
34:35 - Laura Dolphin: So if you wanted to, you could rename them now and start fresh.
34:40 - Laura Dolphin: I just am calling out if you're trying to rename, because again, there's
four places.
34:45 - Laura Dolphin: the opportunity will be where you're probably going to run into more
like potential issues because that field on the opportunity has been around.
34:55 - Laura Dolphin: since before I started.
34:57 - Laura Dolphin: And then the roles, which are used in AIO, you can rename those easily,
but they...
35:04 - Laura Dolphin: They're used with AIO.
35:05 - Laura Dolphin: We've got them.
35:07 - Laura Dolphin: like intertwined with automations and stuff.
35:09 - Laura Dolphin: So we'd have to update those.
35:11 - Laura Dolphin: So it really just comes down to.
35:15 - Laura Dolphin: you skim off whatever is not necessary to get your data model out.
35:20 - Laura Dolphin: Otherwise it just means that like everything you introduce scope,
scope creep, right.
35:25 - Laura Dolphin: Is just going to mean like the delay, the launches later.
35:28 - Laura Dolphin: So try what my recommendation would be is that the less you can
do to get it out and then iterate after the better.
35:37 - Laura Dolphin: so that it doesn't just continue to creep and creep and creep.
35:41 - Lyndon Elam: That's fine.
35:43 - Lyndon Elam: Do you need this logged somewhere so that we don't lose sight of it?
35:50 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah, I'll do like a recap
35:52 - Lyndon Elam: email with
35:53 - Laura Dolphin: your actions
35:54 - Lyndon Elam: and
35:54 - Laura Dolphin: mine.
35:54 - Laura Dolphin: Okay.
35:55 - Lyndon Elam: And I think your third question was answered through the...
35:59 - Lyndon Elam: conversation about direct and title loan cash out, right?
36:03 - Laura Dolphin: Yes.
36:03 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
36:04 - Laura Dolphin: So we'll continue that.
36:05 - Laura Dolphin: We'll revisit that.
36:07 - Laura Dolphin: okay once you have the answer from jacob because depending on
that outcome
36:13 - Laura Dolphin: it will likely
36:14 - Lyndon Elam: change
36:16 - Laura Dolphin: like a few things.
36:19 - Laura Dolphin: In terms of the actual intake, I can easily implement the lake.
36:23 - Laura Dolphin: which one is it direct other, but if they choose the direct, I won't be
able to fully.
36:31 - Laura Dolphin: like fulfill or automate that path until I actually know.
36:34 - Laura Dolphin: Cause right now what it's doing is when they select the title loan, it
automatically gets that title loan renamed to cash out whatever account and associates us
with the opportunity so that the lease works integration can grab that vendor ID, that vendor
number.
36:48 - Lyndon Elam: Yeah.
36:49 - Lyndon Elam: Makes sense.
36:50 - Lyndon Elam: Michael, do you know off the top of your head who our contact at
Leaseworks is?
36:53 - Lyndon Elam: I have a feeling this is going to go down the path of, I don't know.
36:57 - Lyndon Elam: I've just been told that this is what's needed.
37:00 - Laura Dolphin: I mean, I have that information.
37:03 - Laura Dolphin: Do you want me to?
37:05 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah, I can initiate an email if you like and CC yourself and Jacob and
just ask the question.
37:10 - Lyndon Elam: Sure.
37:11 - Lyndon Elam: Let's get that going just so that it's rolling and I'll walk the 12 steps to
talk to Jacob right after we hang up.
37:19 - Laura Dolphin: Okay, thanks.
37:22 - Laura Dolphin: Okay, those are my only questions.
37:26 - Laura Dolphin: Otherwise, there's nothing in there that's a lot of it's just rejigging with
the intake flow.
37:30 - Laura Dolphin: So I can get going on most of those changes.
37:33 - Laura Dolphin: if you're happy with that.
37:36 - Laura Dolphin: And then once I
37:37 - Michael Kianmahd: know
37:37 - Laura Dolphin: the whole direct, then we'll talk.
37:39 - Laura Dolphin: Sorry, what was that?
37:40 - Michael Kianmahd: Could you pull up your map again real fast?
37:42 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
37:49 - Michael Kianmahd: Item.
37:54 - Michael Kianmahd: Item 3.
37:58 - Laura Dolphin: Are you talking about stage three or are you talking about Lynn's
email?
38:03 - Michael Kianmahd: Item three, Lynn's email.
38:05 - Laura Dolphin: Oh, yeah.
38:06 - Laura Dolphin: So that's not actually a question.
38:08 - Laura Dolphin: I just relabeled it.
38:09 - Laura Dolphin: I put like system.
38:11 - Laura Dolphin: Wait, hang on.
38:11 - Laura Dolphin: Sorry, that's wrong.
38:13 - Michael Kianmahd: Is RSC vendor or broker right in the middle of your screen?
38:16 - Michael Kianmahd: The diamond?
38:18 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah, again, this is just, it's not like a, it's like a system.
38:22 - Laura Dolphin: Like I said, it's like, this doesn't represent every single screen.
38:26 - Laura Dolphin: It's just to show you that like.
38:29 - Laura Dolphin: because they would have preselected it early on, then we're just saying
like, which one is it?
38:34 - Laura Dolphin: And it's literally just to make it so that the flowchart's not like massive.
38:38 - Laura Dolphin: That's all that's doing.
38:42 - Laura Dolphin: Okay,
38:44 - Michael Kianmahd: yeah, you still have system.
38:47 - Michael Kianmahd: Misspelled but all good
38:51 - Laura Dolphin: Tchau.
38:53 - Laura Dolphin: I usually color code the squares and stuff too to identify like user
versus system, but I just didn't have time.
38:58 - Laura Dolphin: Or like put swim lanes in, but I just expedited it to get it
39:01 - Lyndon Elam: out.
39:02 - Lyndon Elam: Yeah, this is super helpful.
39:04 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah, anyways, I love flowcharts.
39:07 - Michael Kianmahd: So general comment, like...
39:09 - Michael Kianmahd: Can we build?
39:12 - Michael Kianmahd: maps before we build in the future?
39:15 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah, but just remember that this is a live thing.
39:19 - Laura Dolphin: So I probably did have...
39:22 - Laura Dolphin: I'm assuming I had something like this when we built, when we started
this, the one that's in production.
39:29 - Laura Dolphin: it was very minimal and it was like it kind of just like grew and grew
and grew and grew and then with the data model it was like all we did really was lay over the
data model changes there we didn't do a lot of like refactoring of the flow itself
39:44 - Laura Dolphin: So we can absolutely do that, but it wasn't really like this specific flow
wasn't really in the design phase.
39:51 - Laura Dolphin: It was already something that was live and it was just one of the items
that was updated as part of the data model.
39:59 - Michael Kianmahd: I understand.
40:01 - Laura Dolphin: I'm more so relied on like these things when I did the data model
around like laying over the high level changes and then.
40:10 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah, there's a lot of different processes and stuff.
40:14 - Michael Kianmahd: I just noticed a recurring pattern where...
40:21 - Michael Kianmahd: Like...
40:25 - Michael Kianmahd: testing is done before we build something that like is fully
40:29 - Michael Kianmahd: We thought through and developed and we're testing things that
are like not optimal.
40:35 - Michael Kianmahd: And then we're giving feedback on systems that are built in such
a way that's not optimal based on advice that doesn't include.
40:42 - Michael Kianmahd: The full broad picture perspective.
40:46 - Michael Kianmahd: and then it ends up taking longer.
40:47 - Michael Kianmahd: So because you're going back and forth a lot longer.
40:50 - Michael Kianmahd: So I think what I'm trying to do is I'm trying to concentrate on
40:55 - Michael Kianmahd: planning first, design, iterating, design, iterating, and then build-
ing.
41:02 - Michael Kianmahd: Because I think that would probably...
41:06 - Michael Kianmahd: lead to probably less friction.
41:08 - Michael Kianmahd: It'll be more efficient in terms of delivery.
41:10 - Michael Kianmahd: There'll be less questions along the way and UAT will be a lot
shorter.
41:17 - Michael Kianmahd: That's a hypothesis.
41:18 - Michael Kianmahd: Do you agree with that?
41:24 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah, I mean, yes, I agree in theory.
41:27 - Laura Dolphin: It's just I did show the exact same flow that you tested with Louie.
41:31 - Laura Dolphin: I showed that on the steering committee, I think, two weeks ago.
41:34 - Laura Dolphin: And everybody, everyone was on it and nobody said anything about
it.
41:41 - Laura Dolphin: So it demonstrated the flow as it was.
41:44 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
41:44 - Laura Dolphin: Live where it said like, you know, title loan and all that kind of stuff.
41:48 - Laura Dolphin: And nobody said anything about that.
41:50 - Laura Dolphin: So
41:51 - Michael Kianmahd: I missed it.
41:52 - Michael Kianmahd: Right.
41:53 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah.
41:53 - Laura Dolphin: But I mean, how I can do this kind of thing and I can go through flow
charts.
41:58 - Laura Dolphin: it's more just like the feedback that I get, I take that at face value and
it gets implemented.
42:03 - Laura Dolphin: And then, so I will do, I will absolutely, I love flow charts.
42:08 - Laura Dolphin: I prefer to like build it out and then like show it and then get the
feedback like Lynn gave, which was so helpful.
42:14 - Laura Dolphin: I love that like cycle and process.
42:16 - Michael Kianmahd: So
42:17 - Laura Dolphin: I will absolutely follow that on my end, as long as people are paying
the relevant like attention and giving the right feedback.
42:25 - Laura Dolphin: and then that feedback if implemented I need to know that like I can
trust that so as long as like I guess you guys are holding up your end then I'll hold up mine
and make sure that I stick to like that cycle of like the design sign off build
42:41 - Laura Dolphin: And I'm happy to spend more time if changes are requested or made
updating the documentation first before we actually go to build.
42:49 - Laura Dolphin: and then like making sure that it's right before we actually go to build.
42:52 - Laura Dolphin: I completely agree.
42:53 - Laura Dolphin: I just need to make sure that when I do get that feedback, I need to
know who I'm supposed to go to and who's the right person to sign off on that.
43:02 - Lyndon Elam: I think we resolved that on this call, right?
43:05 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
43:07 - Laura Dolphin: So
43:07 - Lyndon Elam: it's this group.
43:09 - Michael Kianmahd: I think so.
43:10 - Michael Kianmahd: And I think we need to pull because like there's certain workflows
or certain nuances that like only Jay has in his head.
43:16 - Michael Kianmahd: And I think we're trying to get his opinion to make sure it's built
into design.
43:19 - Michael Kianmahd: But it's sometimes I've noticed.
43:22 - Michael Kianmahd: You're, you're, you know, hearing him asking him questions.
43:28 - Michael Kianmahd: and then digesting the information and then synthesizing that
into an action or design feature.
43:33 - Michael Kianmahd: and that could be very time consuming and I think we can
43:37 - Michael Kianmahd: shelter your time from that by taking responsibility, but it's much
easier to do when we have a visual guide that we could look at and like whiteboard along the
way.
43:48 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah, for sure.
43:49 - Michael Kianmahd: Agree.
43:50 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah.
43:51 - Michael Kianmahd: So if that's your preferred way of working and we need to do a
better job paying attention.
43:56 - Michael Kianmahd: when you're presenting something like that.
44:00 - Michael Kianmahd: then maybe it's a document that we have in hand and digest
before it's flashed on a steering committee so we can actually engage with it.
44:09 - Michael Kianmahd: not in that broad of a group because that's a group where that
document may not be relevant.
44:14 - Michael Kianmahd: So it's not.
44:15 - Michael Kianmahd: you know kind of forces us to rush through it because we've got
to be sensitive to everyone's time so maybe that's not the best way
44:22 - Michael Kianmahd: to digest it.
44:22 - Michael Kianmahd: Like sometimes you have to sit on it.
44:24 - Michael Kianmahd: Um,
44:26 - Michael Kianmahd: But like where we landed, like with the revised flow chart and sort
of a sharpened understanding of like.
44:33 - Michael Kianmahd: the least number of clicks and the easiest flow with less friction
and all that kind of stuff.
44:38 - Michael Kianmahd: what is a week as a result of
44:42 - Michael Kianmahd: me identifying something that didn't make sense when louis
randomly showed me something
44:46 - Michael Kianmahd: to Lynn taking first stab and iterating two or three times on the
chart with my feedback and then entering again when we brought the bigger group in after
we saw your version because you built it.
44:58 - Michael Kianmahd: you took what Lynn built and you added a layer to it that I don't
think we could have done on our own.
45:03 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah, I did.
45:04 - Laura Dolphin: Honestly, I didn't use lens very much.
45:06 - Laura Dolphin: Like I just created what was there.
45:09 - Laura Dolphin: yeah it didn't take me long to create it because I was just literally
copying what was in salesforce and then I used his to just apply the changes to the desired
state just like rejig it a little based off of what was there so
45:23 - Laura Dolphin: I'm usually pretty quick at flowcharts and usually like my strength is
mapping processes out.
45:29 - Laura Dolphin: So you tell me, cause obviously then you're like new here too and
you're learning a lot as well.
45:35 - Laura Dolphin: So if you want processes mapped out.
45:39 - Laura Dolphin: Also, just ask for them to if there's anything that I can help that will
help with the discussion, feel free to just say, like, can you map this out?
45:47 - Laura Dolphin: As I might even have it already mapped out or documented in a way
that I can just get a flowchart going.
45:56 - Laura Dolphin: But yeah.
45:57 - Lyndon Elam: Okay.
45:58 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
46:00 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah.
46:01 - Michael Kianmahd: Okay.
46:02 - Michael Kianmahd: It was illuminating for me.
46:03 - Laura Dolphin: So
46:04 - Michael Kianmahd: I just.
46:04 - Michael Kianmahd: I want to deliver more efficiently and faster.
46:07 - Michael Kianmahd: And I just feel like that's the best path.
46:08 - Michael Kianmahd: So we're all aligned on that.
46:11 - Michael Kianmahd: So let's just
46:11 - Laura Dolphin: do it.
46:12 - Laura Dolphin: Okay.
46:12 - Laura Dolphin: Is there any other that you can think of right now, like any other
processes that are not illuminated for you that you would like me to?
46:19 - Laura Dolphin: to draw out so that we can like any points of
46:23 - Laura Dolphin: Like the Leaseworks, for example.
46:25 - Laura Dolphin: I mean, there's not really much there.
46:26 - Laura Dolphin: It's just like user clicks button and it goes to Leaseworks.
46:30 - Laura Dolphin: But as an example, is there anything that is in your head that we know
we might want, especially with like data model and that kind of stuff?
46:38 - Laura Dolphin: Most of the processes are the same, but.
46:41 - Lyndon Elam: With the changes to the data model and the
46:42 - Laura Dolphin: alignment
46:44 - Lyndon Elam: within stages, I think seeing the application flow mapped out.
46:49 - Lyndon Elam: would be useful.
46:51 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
46:51 - Laura Dolphin: You mean like with the new sales stages?
46:54 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
46:54 - Laura Dolphin: Okay.
46:56 - Laura Dolphin: Easy.
46:57 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah.
46:58 - Michael Kianmahd: Credit workflow, doc and funding workflow.
47:02 - Michael Kianmahd: I think those are the ones that create the most friction for our
referral partners and customers.
47:09 - Michael Kianmahd: So if there's any improvement we could make there, I think that
might be valuable.
47:15 - Laura Dolphin: I do need to, on my list, I do need to create the high-level overview for
AIoD to update that from what we had.
47:24 - Laura Dolphin: I haven't focused on that because obviously this is my priority, but
yeah, I can do that.
47:34 - Lyndon Elam: All right.
47:35 - Laura Dolphin: What about
47:36 - Michael Kianmahd: credit scoring or like any of that?
47:39 - Michael Kianmahd: Is that going to be part of the credit map?
47:44 - Laura Dolphin: Yes, yeah, I mean.
47:48 - Laura Dolphin: Yes, there's not really anything that changes against the process for
credit with the data model.
47:55 - Laura Dolphin: If you want to see that process mapped out, then that's part of the
credit workflow.
47:59 - Laura Dolphin: um the only real changes is the way that we're scoring um and like
most of that is
48:06 - Laura Dolphin: on Kitten Alt Score side.
48:08 - Laura Dolphin: So from a flow chart perspective, there's not much that differs.
48:12 - Laura Dolphin: other than like the record types but yeah there's yeah
48:19 - Michael Kianmahd: Okay.
48:20 - Michael Kianmahd: All right, Laura, thank
48:22 - Laura Dolphin: you.
48:22 - Laura Dolphin: Okay.
48:23 - Laura Dolphin: Thanks, both.
48:24 - Laura Dolphin: Enjoy their
48:24 - Lyndon Elam: students.
48:25 - Lyndon Elam: Bye-bye.
