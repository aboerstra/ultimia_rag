Maxim x Faye Planning Transcript
00:11 - Michael Kianmahd: And repeat.
00:47 - Michael Kianmahd: different forces.
00:58 - Michael Kianmahd: Boa noite.
01:14 - Michael Kianmahd: Hey.
01:15 - Laura Dolphin: Hello.
01:16 - Michael Kianmahd: What's up?
01:17 - Michael Kianmahd: How's it
01:18 - Laura Dolphin: going?
01:19 - Michael Kianmahd: Okay.
01:22 - Michael Kianmahd: Awesome.
01:23 - Laura Dolphin: Okay.
01:23 - Laura Dolphin: I don't have much for today, just the CEO stuff.
01:28 - Michael Kianmahd: Yes.
01:31 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah, you had wanted me to just remind you that the COO is starting
next week and that we wanted to maybe book some time with me.
01:39 - Laura Dolphin: I also saw your email for access.
01:40 - Laura Dolphin: I'll do that.
01:42 - Laura Dolphin: do you want him as a system admin or what access do you want him
to have?
01:47 - Michael Kianmahd: I probably need your help with that.
01:51 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
01:52 - Laura Dolphin: So you just tell me like what access you want him to have and I'll
figure out the specifics.
02:03 - Michael Kianmahd: I don't think he needs like, I think he should have full access.
02:11 - Michael Kianmahd: I just don't know if he needs it like day one.
02:15 - Laura Dolphin: Okay, do you want to just start him where he's kind of able to like read
everything like just like view stuff?
02:21 - Laura Dolphin: no like administration he can see everything but he doesn't need to
like necessarily he's not going to be like creating opportunities and stuff like that right
02:31 - Michael Kianmahd: I think he should have that level of access.
02:34 - Michael Kianmahd: I think he should have credit access.
02:36 - Michael Kianmahd: I think he should have conga access.
02:38 - Michael Kianmahd: I think he needs to have enough access so that he could dive in
if he wants to.
02:43 - Laura Dolphin: Yes, but you do that in like a sandbox.
02:46 - Laura Dolphin: So he can be like a full admin in the full copy sandbox.
02:49 - Laura Dolphin: So he can
02:49 - Michael Kianmahd: like see
02:50 - Laura Dolphin: all the data and all that stuff.
02:51 - Laura Dolphin: Like if he wants to play around, we don't do that in production.
02:54 - Laura Dolphin: We do that in a sandbox.
02:55 - Laura Dolphin: But like for production, do you just like...
02:58 - Laura Dolphin: Do you just want him to be able to see everything?
03:01 - Laura Dolphin: He'll probably want to report.
03:02 - Laura Dolphin: So like from his data, you analyze data and yeah.
03:07 - Laura Dolphin: So like just being able to like see everything, run reports, things like
that.
03:12 - Michael Kianmahd: Sounds right.
03:12 - Michael Kianmahd: I probably want him to do credit too.
03:14 - Michael Kianmahd: And I want him to be able to do a submission.
03:17 - Michael Kianmahd: I want him to be able to do editing too, because I think he's going
03:19 - Laura Dolphin: to have to.
03:20 - Laura Dolphin: okay
03:20 - Michael Kianmahd: yeah so
03:22 - Laura Dolphin: okay he
03:22 - Michael Kianmahd: should be able to jump in and render a credit approval if he needs
to
03:26 - Laura Dolphin: Okay.
03:27 - Laura Dolphin: Yep.
03:27 - Laura Dolphin: Sounds good.
03:28 - Laura Dolphin: I'll just give him access and then just like not system administration.
03:31 - Laura Dolphin: And if he wants that, he can have it in a sandbox.
03:33 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah, perfect.
03:34 - Michael Kianmahd: And then we can change it as he...
03:37 - Michael Kianmahd: He excels in his role.
03:41 - Laura Dolphin: Exciting.
03:41 - Laura Dolphin: You must be so excited.
03:45 - Michael Kianmahd: I'm excited.
03:46 - Laura Dolphin: Nice.
03:47 - Laura Dolphin: What's his background?
03:48 - Laura Dolphin: Like equipment financing, but like COO as well?
03:53 - Michael Kianmahd: Yes.
03:54 - Michael Kianmahd: He didn't work in equipment financing.
03:55 - Michael Kianmahd: He worked in subprime auto finance.
03:58 - Laura Dolphin: Right.
03:58 - Laura Dolphin: Okay.
03:59 - Michael Kianmahd: That's actually where Jacob came from as well.
04:02 - Michael Kianmahd: There's a lot of crossover.
04:04 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
04:07 - Michael Kianmahd: but he's he seems pretty solid so
04:10 - Laura Dolphin: thanks
04:11 - Michael Kianmahd: yeah i think it's going to be a little bit of a learning curve
04:14 - Michael Kianmahd: for like specifically like trucks and yellow iron and
04:20 - Laura Dolphin: you know
04:20 - Michael Kianmahd: the concepts are the same
04:22 - Laura Dolphin: yeah um
04:26 - Michael Kianmahd: But he has, he's kind of seen how it's how it can happen at scale
in auto finance.
04:33 - Michael Kianmahd: And I think it's kind of, I think there's going to be some.
04:37 - Michael Kianmahd: some benefit to having had that experience because the way
that business runs is like way more efficient, way more consumer driven, way more rapid
approvals, rapid fundings, rapid collections.
04:48 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
04:48 - Michael Kianmahd: They're way more integrated with a bunch of data sources.
04:52 - Michael Kianmahd: He was...
04:54 - Michael Kianmahd: on a couple of like advisory committees with like plaid and
04:59 - Michael Kianmahd: Painier Me and a couple of other
05:03 - Michael Kianmahd: sort of consumer car related things.
05:05 - Michael Kianmahd: So like,
05:06 - Laura Dolphin: Okay.
05:07 - Michael Kianmahd: I think you'll be good.
05:09 - Laura Dolphin: Awesome.
05:09 - Laura Dolphin: That's exciting.
05:11 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah.
05:11 - Laura Dolphin: Okay.
05:12 - Laura Dolphin: Well, I'll get him access.
05:14 - Laura Dolphin: He doesn't start till Monday though, right?
05:15 - Michael Kianmahd: Monday.
05:16 - Laura Dolphin: Okay, yeah, so I'll do it.
05:17 - Laura Dolphin: There's no rush.
05:18 - Laura Dolphin: I'll do that this week, either today or tomorrow.
05:22 - Laura Dolphin: And for when you want time with...
05:26 - Laura Dolphin: like me, do you want to schedule that now?
05:28 - Laura Dolphin: Or do you want me to just like reach out to him on his first day and
we can schedule
05:33 - Michael Kianmahd: that?
05:33 - Michael Kianmahd: I think
05:34 - Michael Kianmahd: Calm.
05:36 - Michael Kianmahd: So I move the workshop to three o'clock.
05:40 - Laura Dolphin: I can't, I can't make that.
05:43 - Laura Dolphin: I have a family visiting from New Zealand next week.
05:47 - Laura Dolphin: So I'm stopping my days at like sort of 3 4 p.m.
05:50 - Laura Dolphin: My time which is like midday your time.
05:53 - Michael Kianmahd: That's no problem
05:56 - Michael Kianmahd: And then I think the next time we can chat is that 11 o'clock, that
September 11th meeting.
06:10 - Michael Kianmahd: actually
06:11 - Laura Dolphin: it's gonna be his meeting and i'll step out you know yeah sounds good
um if if he wants like i do have
06:18 - Laura Dolphin: time if he if you want me to like actually do like a run through with
him at all might be a little bit early but if he if you do just let me know and I'll set up some
time with him to like take him through anything
06:32 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah, well, can we
06:33 - Laura Dolphin: target to do that on the 11th?
06:36 - Laura Dolphin: Oh, yeah, absolutely.
06:37 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
06:38 - Laura Dolphin: Do you want to make that an hour?
06:40 - Laura Dolphin: Or an hour
06:42 - Michael Kianmahd: will be good.
06:44 - Michael Kianmahd: I think
06:46 - Michael Kianmahd: I think half an hour is fine and then we could do follow-ups.
06:48 - Michael Kianmahd: What I don't want to do is I don't want to overwhelm him with a
bunch of information that he has
06:52 - Laura Dolphin: no idea what he's
06:52 - Michael Kianmahd: like.
06:53 - Michael Kianmahd: I kind of...
06:54 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah.
06:55 - Michael Kianmahd: And
06:55 - Laura Dolphin: he's probably going to have his
06:56 - Michael Kianmahd: own way of doing it.
06:58 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah.
06:59 - Michael Kianmahd: Okay.
06:59 - Michael Kianmahd: So, yeah, I think he knows about you and about Faye and he
knows about Ken and he knows about.
07:06 - Michael Kianmahd: the
07:06 - Laura Dolphin: team and
07:06 - Michael Kianmahd: he's met a lot of people already.
07:08 - Michael Kianmahd: And, you
07:09 - Laura Dolphin: know, I'm excited to kind of see him run.
07:12 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah, I bet.
07:13 - Laura Dolphin: Okay.
07:13 - Laura Dolphin: Well, I'll just, I'll let him.
07:17 - Laura Dolphin: reach
07:17 - Michael Kianmahd: out
07:18 - Laura Dolphin: and tell me what he
07:18 - Michael Kianmahd: needs from me and then I will assist.
07:21 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah, I think we'll, I think kind of like first
07:23 - Laura Dolphin: jumping off point would
07:24 - Michael Kianmahd: be next week on Thursday.
07:25 - Michael Kianmahd: Okay.
07:26 - Michael Kianmahd: And then
07:27 - Laura Dolphin: I'm sure it'll
07:27 - Michael Kianmahd: naturally evolve on its own.
07:28 - Michael Kianmahd: Sounds good.
07:30 - Michael Kianmahd: Cool.
07:32 - Michael Kianmahd: Going back to your other comment about getting docs.
07:36 - Laura Dolphin: in
07:37 - Michael Kianmahd: order and all that?
07:38 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah.
07:39 - Michael Kianmahd: Very specific question about that.
07:41 - Michael Kianmahd: So if we decide...
07:43 - Michael Kianmahd: that we cannot get everything together quickly enough, how
many hours do you think we burn?
07:52 - Michael Kianmahd: Just to kind of get the TR stuff right.
07:56 - Laura Dolphin: So we are working on that.
07:59 - Laura Dolphin: Anyways, like basically what it means is that we will just use the
documents that you have today.
08:07 - Laura Dolphin: and we'll build the solutions and we'll...
08:13 - Laura Dolphin: Amen.
08:18 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah, so we
08:20 - Michael Kianmahd: can...
08:21 - Michael Kianmahd: I think what I'm prioritizing...
08:24 - Michael Kianmahd: What I'm prioritizing is getting him in and he's the solution for a
lot of this stuff.
08:29 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah, fair.
08:29 - Michael Kianmahd: And I think it will be a really good experience for him to go
08:32 - Laura Dolphin: through this
08:32 - Michael Kianmahd: himself with his eyes.
08:34 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah.
08:35 - Michael Kianmahd: And ask, like, why do we need this step?
08:36 - Michael Kianmahd: Why is it important?
08:37 - Michael Kianmahd: Why is it relevant?
08:38 - Michael Kianmahd: I think he'll learn a lot very quickly in that period of time.
08:41 - Michael Kianmahd: But it might take,
08:42 - Laura Dolphin: like, an extra few weeks.
08:44 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah, it's, we basically lose the 40.
08:50 - Laura Dolphin: So hours for this month of that resource where that's where they were
meant to do, meant to be.
08:58 - Laura Dolphin: What I would recommend is that because we can get so we can get
probably about like 25% of the way through, maybe a little bit more like 40%.
09:08 - Laura Dolphin: We'll do that.
09:10 - Laura Dolphin: And then we'll pause because the next part of that will be to
09:13 - Michael Kianmahd: actually
09:13 - Laura Dolphin: get into the actual documents.
09:16 - Laura Dolphin: So we can pause there, it might be worth like finding or going and
starting on another like mini project, just so that we can use the resources.
09:26 - Laura Dolphin: And then we're not like wasting hours.
09:28 - Laura Dolphin: And it just means ultimately that the data model overall, like you're
not going to get it this month.
09:34 - Laura Dolphin: It'll just be delayed.
09:37 - Laura Dolphin: Also fine.
09:39 - Laura Dolphin: It's just, yeah, I don't want to like lose the hours because it's like a use
it or lose it.
09:43 - Laura Dolphin: It's not like we're not using it this month.
09:45 - Laura Dolphin: Let's just put it all next month.
09:47 - Laura Dolphin: So.
09:49 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah, is there anything that we want to like move up?
09:54 - Laura Dolphin: I don't have the thing open because my computer crashed this
morning.
10:02 - Laura Dolphin: do you want me to look through and just kind of like find meaningful
10:06 - Laura Dolphin: work that I can assign out because a lot of it will also come down to
like, what is it me or is it someone else?
10:13 - Laura Dolphin: It's the someone else.
10:15 - Laura Dolphin: do you want me to go through and just like find work that I can keep
busy for?
10:19 - Laura Dolphin: X amount of time.
10:30 - Michael Kianmahd: So are you saying that the 40 hours...
10:34 - Michael Kianmahd: that you had an engineer allocated for it was figuring out all the
DocuSign stuff.
10:40 - Laura Dolphin: Well, so kind of, yeah.
10:42 - Laura Dolphin: So the 40 hours is like another consultant.
10:46 - Laura Dolphin: It's a cheaper consultant, basically.
10:49 - Laura Dolphin: They're not an engineer.
10:51 - Laura Dolphin: That's kind of the issue is that like their main priority was going to be
this part of the project where they're like managing the conga and the docusign.
11:02 - Laura Dolphin: So like there's work this month, there's work next month, there'll be
ongoing work, that kind of stuff.
11:06 - Laura Dolphin: So like without having that.
11:09 - Laura Dolphin: then I'll need to find work that they can do because they're not an
engineer.
11:14 - Laura Dolphin: They're not me.
11:15 - Laura Dolphin: they're not necessarily they can't just go into like our roadmap and be
like okay i'll pick this one out
11:20 - Laura Dolphin: A, because there's dependencies and B, because they just might not
be like ready to do that.
11:24 - Laura Dolphin: But there will be
11:25 - Michael Kianmahd: definitely
11:26 - Laura Dolphin: like work that we can do.
11:27 - Laura Dolphin: It's just that I'll have to kind of go in and find stuff.
11:31 - Laura Dolphin: And what it will mean, I just want to be very clear, is that like we will
deliver stuff.
11:35 - Laura Dolphin: but the overall data model is going to get put on hold.
11:40 - Laura Dolphin: So I just wanted like,
11:41 - Michael Kianmahd: as long
11:41 - Laura Dolphin: as you're okay with
11:42 - Michael Kianmahd: that, then I'm good with it.
11:44 - Michael Kianmahd: I'd rather not do that.
11:46 - Michael Kianmahd: So I'm wondering how else we could do that.
11:51 - Michael Kianmahd: So I think the choice you gave me the other day, maybe I got this
wrong.
11:54 - Michael Kianmahd: It was like, we just use the current docs we have in place.
11:57 - Michael Kianmahd: So you change the data model and then you adapt the current
docs that we have.
12:02 - Michael Kianmahd: So that's why
12:02 - Laura Dolphin: I was asking, like, how many hours do you burn if we do that?
12:05 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
12:06 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah, kind of.
12:07 - Laura Dolphin: So like the docs today are very TR.
12:11 - Laura Dolphin: But that's what we have.
12:12 - Laura Dolphin: So we would just kind of use those.
12:13 - Laura Dolphin: And like, if.
12:15 - Laura Dolphin: you want to just make those work for like, so TR is heavy equipment
and then like structured financing, you either have to tell us if that's TR or BL, we could just
utilize like what we have there.
12:28 - Laura Dolphin: and then we can change it later.
12:30 - Laura Dolphin: It's almost what I'd lean on recommending because
12:34 - Laura Dolphin: if you try and introduce too much change to other things.
12:38 - Laura Dolphin: in the middle of a project, you end up with scope creep.
12:44 - Laura Dolphin: So we can do it, but yeah, we would basically just have to take like the
docs that you have there and use those.
12:56 - Michael Kianmahd: To not
12:56 - Laura Dolphin: lose data
12:57 - Michael Kianmahd: model time.
13:00 - Laura Dolphin: I'm thinking
13:00 - Michael Kianmahd: we do that.
13:03 - Michael Kianmahd: And then I'm
13:03 - Laura Dolphin: thinking the bigger thing is.
13:06 - Laura Dolphin: like kind of Lynn's baby.
13:09 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah,
13:09 - Michael Kianmahd: absolutely.
13:10 - Michael Kianmahd: And it's a good one for him to own.
13:12 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah, because then he gets to go into the weeds and like kind of
13:16 - Laura Dolphin: figure out why we're doing certain things a certain way.
13:18 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah, but now it's not the time for him to like do that because it'll take
longer than.
13:22 - Laura Dolphin: a
13:22 - Michael Kianmahd: few
13:22 - Laura Dolphin: weeks.
13:23 - Michael Kianmahd: He's just starting.
13:25 - Michael Kianmahd: I literally don't have...
13:28 - Laura Dolphin: time like i literally do not have time i understand um okay so um is
13:35 - Laura Dolphin: Are you and Charles and Juan, like, do you still, are you able to provide
me like a little bit of like a mapping and a guide for like?
13:44 - Laura Dolphin: today this is this, this is that, or should I just work with Charles and
Juan and Louis and figure that out?
13:50 - Laura Dolphin: because I'll still need that.
13:51 - Laura Dolphin: We are changing
13:52 - Michael Kianmahd: like enough.
13:54 - Michael Kianmahd: For TR docs?
13:57 - Laura Dolphin: Well, so heavy equipment, structured financing.
14:01 - Laura Dolphin: um real estate let's just back for now but like i need to know like heavy
equipment and structured financing so i'll just need to know like which docs go with which
14:13 - Laura Dolphin: But I can work with Charles and give them a template, I guess.
14:17 - Michael Kianmahd: Please.
14:18 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah.
14:18 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah.
14:19 - Michael Kianmahd: So he's out.
14:22 - Laura Dolphin: Friday,
14:23 - Michael Kianmahd: tomorrow.
14:24 - Michael Kianmahd: And then he's going to be out for three and a half weeks.
14:29 - Michael Kianmahd: He did mention that starting like starting the 12th.
14:31 - Michael Kianmahd: Wow.
14:35 - Laura Dolphin: Okay, so I've got him
14:36 - Michael Kianmahd: for like early next week kind of thing
14:38 - Laura Dolphin: Kind of thing, yeah.
14:40 - Michael Kianmahd: Okay, yeah, that's fine.
14:41 - Michael Kianmahd: I will...
14:42 - Michael Kianmahd: Beyond that, Laura, I'm
14:44 - Laura Dolphin: expecting Jay back on the 8th.
14:46 - Michael Kianmahd: Oh, okay.
14:48 - Michael Kianmahd: By the way, do you want me
14:48 - Laura Dolphin: to send you a GoFundMe link for him?
14:51 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah, sure.
14:52 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah, I did send him a message.
14:53 - Laura Dolphin: yeah i like think about it all the time it's horrible um yeah please do
15:03 - Michael Kianmahd: So let me send that to you.
15:07 - Michael Kianmahd: I think this is it.
15:12 - Laura Dolphin: Okay.
15:13 - Laura Dolphin: No
15:13 - Michael Kianmahd: pressure.
15:14 - Michael Kianmahd: Yep.
15:16 - Michael Kianmahd: If you think anybody at Fay
15:17 - Laura Dolphin: wants to contribute, feel free.
15:19 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
15:20 - Michael Kianmahd: For sure.
15:23 - Michael Kianmahd: But I did talk to him yesterday and he's like, no, I kind of want to
come back.
15:26 - Michael Kianmahd: And I'm like, if you need more time, let me know.
15:28 - Michael Kianmahd: But I think he'll be
15:29 - Laura Dolphin: pretty consequential in that effort.
15:32 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah, he will.
15:32 - Laura Dolphin: OK.
15:33 - Laura Dolphin: I didn't know that he would be back.
15:34 - Laura Dolphin: But yeah, I would imagine that he would want to keep his mind
15:37 - Michael Kianmahd: busy.
15:38 - Laura Dolphin: That's probably what I would want to do.
15:41 - Laura Dolphin: Okay, cool.
15:42 - Laura Dolphin: Well, that's good to know.
15:43 - Laura Dolphin: I will reach out to them and work with them.
15:47 - Laura Dolphin: Okay.
15:47 - Laura Dolphin: Anything else you need from me?
15:49 - Laura Dolphin: No.
15:50 - Laura Dolphin: I'm going to sneak in validation rules and
15:53 - Michael Kianmahd: automations today.
15:56 - Michael Kianmahd: I saw something
15:56 - Laura Dolphin: Charles sent this morning.
16:01 - Michael Kianmahd: I don't think you were copied on it, but.
16:04 - Michael Kianmahd: Was it an MHC
16:05 - Laura Dolphin: thing?
16:06 - Laura Dolphin: I think so.
16:07 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah, I think I resolved that this morning.
16:10 - Laura Dolphin: I think he, I got confused because Louis came and was like, oh,
apparently you were asking questions on MHC.
16:16 - Laura Dolphin: And I was like, wait, what?
16:17 - Laura Dolphin: But we were chatting and I think I solved it.
16:24 - Michael Kianmahd: Was it
16:24 - Laura Dolphin: around
16:25 - Michael Kianmahd: the fears?
16:28 - Michael Kianmahd: We
16:28 - Laura Dolphin: make things overly complicated.
16:30 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah, yes, I think, yes.
16:38 - Laura Dolphin: You do.
16:40 - Laura Dolphin: I feel like this is one of the ones that the operations manager will be
able to advise on when he gets a little.
16:48 - Laura Dolphin: further in.
16:48 - Laura Dolphin: It's always been on my list to wait, like how you guys have your.
16:52 - Laura Dolphin: commissions and your incentives and your tiers and all this stuff as
like fields of validations on opportunities um that's just yeah
17:01 - Laura Dolphin: not great.
17:05 - Laura Dolphin: I have not tackled it yet, but it's been on my list of things to do for a
while.
17:13 - Laura Dolphin: But yeah, so I fixed it.
17:15 - Laura Dolphin: It was basically just that specific validation rule had an old level of
acceptance.
17:21 - Laura Dolphin: value that we were looking for that got missed when we updated.
17:24 - Laura Dolphin: So I fixed that.
17:25 - Laura Dolphin: But unless there's
