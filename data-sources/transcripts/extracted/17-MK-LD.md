Maxim x Faye Planning Transcript
00:01 - Michael Kianmahd: Kind of more.
00:03 - Adrian Boerstra: Wow, this is really close in on me.
00:05 - Adrian Boerstra: Is it doing some sort of auto crop thing?
00:09 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah.
00:10 - Adrian Boerstra: New feature I was not expecting.
00:12 - Adrian Boerstra: Not expecting that.
00:14 - Michael Kianmahd: I think you could change that.
00:18 - Adrian Boerstra: It feels creepy to me.
00:22 - Michael Kianmahd: Invading your personal space.
00:23 - Adrian Boerstra: Hell yeah, I'm like what?
00:24 - Adrian Boerstra: It was like I created an interactive avatar of myself the other day.
00:30 - Adrian Boerstra: I'm playing with that.
00:31 - Adrian Boerstra: Have you played with Hn at all?
00:33 - Adrian Boerstra: Are you familiar with it?
00:34 - Michael Kianmahd: I've never heard of it.
00:35 - Adrian Boerstra: So it's h-e-y
00:37 - Adrian Boerstra: gen
00:39 - Adrian Boerstra: And we've been starting the I've trained up a model and Faye's been
using
00:45 - Adrian Boerstra: Um my model for to create some videos and stuff
00:47 - Adrian Boerstra: um
00:51 - Adrian Boerstra: So i've got an ai avatar of me
00:53 - Adrian Boerstra: But anyway, I was playing with this interactive avatar, which is
designed so that you can have a conversation
00:58 - Adrian Boerstra: with like an Ai customer service person
01:02 - Adrian Boerstra: and they're visually represented there.
01:05 - Adrian Boerstra: So I created that model and used a knowledge base behind it that
was aimed at teaching you a language.
01:14 - Adrian Boerstra: So I'm sitting there having a conversation with myself and it was a
little bit max headroomy, you know.
01:23 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah.
01:25 - Michael Kianmahd: Hey Laura.
01:26 - Adrian Boerstra: Hi.
01:27 - Adrian Boerstra: but I can't tell you just how creepy it was to be talking to a virtual
version of me.
01:33 - Adrian Boerstra: And it was actually, it kept trying to pull me in back in on topic, as
you can imagine.
01:38 - Adrian Boerstra: I'm like making jokes and stuff.
01:41 - Adrian Boerstra: Laura, I'm talking about this interactive avatar I made a couple of
weeks ago for our marketing department.
01:48 - Adrian Boerstra: I assumed.
01:49 - Adrian Boerstra: I open it up and it's trying to teach me a language and I'm asking it
other things off topic and it got very upset with me.
02:00 - Adrian Boerstra: It felt very stern.
02:02 - Adrian Boerstra: Like, yeah, okay, like I'm making jokes.
02:05 - Adrian Boerstra: It's not really laughing back.
02:07 - Adrian Boerstra: It's like, oh, okay, I see you're trying to make a joke.
02:09 - Adrian Boerstra: All right, let's get, I don't know about that, but let's talk more about
learning German.
02:16 - Adrian Boerstra: And so I ended up getting upset with it and turned it off.
02:23 - Adrian Boerstra: I've never hated myself so much.
02:30 - Adrian Boerstra: I'm actually flying to Munich tomorrow, Michael.
02:34 - Michael Kianmahd: Are you really just for fun?
02:36 - Adrian Boerstra: This one's just my wife and I going for fun.
02:39 - Adrian Boerstra: So we're going to Munich.
02:40 - Adrian Boerstra: I'm renting a car for a couple weeks.
02:42 - Adrian Boerstra: We're going up to Prague, going into Slovenia, Salzburg, and Austria.
02:49 - Adrian Boerstra: So just wandering around.
02:53 - Michael Kianmahd: Prague is really beautiful.
02:55 - Adrian Boerstra: I've never been.
02:56 - Adrian Boerstra: Have you been?
02:57 - Laura: So beautiful.
02:58 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah.
02:58 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah.
02:59 - Adrian Boerstra: I keep hearing how amazing it is.
03:01 - Adrian Boerstra: So that's definitely on the list.
03:03 - Adrian Boerstra: Like basically we get into Munich, we'll be in Munich for, I think, a
day and then we'll be driving right up to just trying to catch our breath a little bit in terms of.
03:15 - Adrian Boerstra: Time zone changes and yeah.
03:19 - Laura: You went to Germany last year, too, didn't you?
03:21 - Adrian Boerstra: I did.
03:21 - Adrian Boerstra: I mean, most of this trip, even though I'm flying in and out of Munich,
Most of the time we won't be in Germany.
03:26 - Adrian Boerstra: We'll be in Austria, Chechnya, Slovenia.
03:31 - Adrian Boerstra: But yeah, last year I was in Germany, Switzerland, France.
03:35 - Adrian Boerstra: And that was with my son.
03:36 - Adrian Boerstra: And then my wife was like, no, Ok, now it's my turn.
03:41 - Laura: Budapest, I don't know if you're going to make it there, but that's also beautiful.
03:44 - Adrian Boerstra: It was one of my favorite cities.
03:46 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah.
03:47 - Adrian Boerstra: I will check that out.
03:49 - Adrian Boerstra: We haven't booked every night of hotel so that we could be a little
bit, let's do what we want to do.
03:56 - Michael Kianmahd: Check out, I think if I'm not mistaken, there's a decent restaurant
on top of this building that I just sent you.
04:04 - Michael Kianmahd: There's a Frank Gehry building.
04:06 - Adrian Boerstra: Oh, that's cool.
04:08 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah.
04:09 - Adrian Boerstra: All right.
04:10 - Adrian Boerstra: We're going to hit it Sunday.
04:14 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah.
04:15 - Michael Kianmahd: Ginger and Fred restaurant.
04:16 - Adrian Boerstra: That's what it's called.
04:17 - Adrian Boerstra: Oh, awesome.
04:18 - Adrian Boerstra: I'll remember that.
04:19 - Adrian Boerstra: I love the Flintstones.
04:21 - Laura: All right, should we get into it, guys?
04:27 - Adrian Boerstra: Real quick, do we have another meeting that Dave is joining?
04:34 - Laura: Yeah, that's in an hour after this, and that's when we're going to review.
04:38 - Laura: Yeah, so we'll take Michael through this, and then hopefully that will be a short
call.
04:43 - Adrian Boerstra: The other one will be shorter, yeah, okay, perfect.
04:46 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah.
04:47 - Adrian Boerstra: Do it.
04:48 - Laura: Okie dokie, I'm going to share my screen.
04:58 - Laura: Got it, okay, I'm going to get a little bit bigger.
05:02 - Laura: Okay, so we're going to orient you to this tool to like how it works and what it's
doing.
05:11 - Laura: And then we're actually going to go through, because this is real, like Maxim
projects with estimates on it.
05:18 - Laura: And what it is meant to do is basically to show you if you want to deliver
05:24 - Laura: certain projects in certain time frames, we'll need to like ramp up spending
and resources
05:31 - Laura: or we can go the other way where we can just stretch things out to keep costs
kind of like
05:37 - Laura: streamlined.
05:38 - Laura: Okay, so just like that.
05:40 - Michael Kianmahd: Spare with me for a minute or two here while I work.
05:42 - Michael Kianmahd: I can't see.
05:43 - Adrian Boerstra: It's like still a little small.
05:44 - Laura: Yeah, can you zoom in?
05:45 - Adrian Boerstra: I'll look on it a little bit.
05:46 - Laura: Yeah.
05:48 - Laura: Is that good?
05:50 - Adrian Boerstra: I got it on my big screen.
05:51 - Adrian Boerstra: Good for me, but you, Michael?
05:53 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah, it's okay.
05:54 - Laura: Okay, perfect.
05:56 - Laura: Okay, so on the left here, we've got the value streams.
05:59 - Laura: These have not changed since we talked about them with you.
06:04 - Laura: The only thing that we have added is like a maintenance project, which
encompasses like Salesforce maintenance type activities.
06:13 - Laura: And then each of the value streams has multiple projects within them.
06:19 - Laura: Okay.
06:20 - Laura: And so on what you're looking at here is like in a calendar view by value stream.
06:27 - Laura: So if I go like that, we've got all of our projects within those value streams.
06:34 - Laura: And then we've kind of slotted them in based off of conversations like that
we've had with you.
06:40 - Laura: So it starts at March so that we can actually go through and show you some
of the larger initiatives or projects that have been completed last quarter.
06:49 - Laura: Right, like in our deal intake flow, Aio Phase 1, migrating users from Classic
to Lightning, which has been on the list forever, and then doing things like helping prevent
costs from Salesforce by removing custom objects.
07:05 - Laura: Okay.
07:06 - Laura: So those are some things there.
07:08 - Laura: When you look at each project, you'll see here a couple things.
07:13 - Laura: So first off, we're going to look to see if it's in progress.
07:16 - Laura: If it's been completed, we see priority.
07:20 - Laura: And then each of these has an estimate associated.
07:24 - Laura: Now the estimate can just be like an overall one, which is like 100 hours, or it
can be broken down by resource.
07:31 - Laura: And what that does is each of those hours goes into like a how much time
overall do we need, and then it's going to tell you how much time you need per month, per
quarter, so on and so forth.
07:45 - Laura: Okay.
07:47 - Laura: And then what the tool does, which is really cool, which we'll talk about in a
second is like it allows you to basically reduce or stretch out certain projects or even move
them around to change the resource allocation, which is what this bar represents, right?
08:03 - Laura: Like how many resources are needed based off of the hours and based off of
all the projects that are needed in a month.
08:11 - Laura: And it will also help adjust automatically the hours that are needed.
08:16 - Laura: So for example, if we're like, okay, well, we don't want to spend 400 hours next
month, we can basically just like push things out, which will reduce the expenditure in that
month and move things around based off of like what's the highest priority for you.
08:31 - Laura: Okay, so just pause here.
08:31 - Laura: Do you have any questions?
08:32 - Michael Kianmahd: Does that make sense?
08:33 - Michael Kianmahd: Perfect.
08:35 - Laura: Love it.
08:36 - Laura: Yeah.
08:37 - Laura: Go Adrian.
08:38 - Laura: Took my brain and put it into like a system, which is what we wanted.
08:43 - Michael Kianmahd: So yeah, him being intercepted by an Ai avatar of himself.
08:47 - Michael Kianmahd: Exactly.
08:48 - Adrian Boerstra: Internal avatar that doesn't He didn't actually do it, it was the avatar.
08:54 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah, damn that avatar, I can't live with it.
08:57 - Michael Kianmahd: You did it in German, that's what you don't even realize.
09:01 - Michael Kianmahd: Okay
09:05 - Laura: so I just toggled it, I'm going to start because we're in the month of June.
09:08 - Laura: We'll just strip out anything that's been completed and we're just going to look
at only current projects only.
09:13 - Laura: So it's just going to strip out anything that is not relevant for this conversation.
09:16 - Adrian Boerstra: Real quick, Laura is if you're not using the value stream filters on
the left hand side, you can close that out to make more room to.
09:23 - Laura: Oh, thank you.
09:26 - Laura: There you go.
09:27 - Laura: Okay.
09:28 - Laura: So first, before we get into like toggling things, because that's really the point
of this call, I want to go through a few and just make sure that we have the actual right
projects.
09:38 - Laura: So this most of these, well, actually, all of these are real things that we want
to do.
09:44 - Laura: Okay.
09:45 - Laura: to take you through and just make sure that we have the right data and just
to check if we're missing anything, because if we are, it'll be relevant to add that in, or even
remove them for like the toggle part.
09:58 - Laura: Okay, so for application intake, we've got the Ai based application intake that
Adrian's been working on now technically that started a while ago, I've just for the sake of
like, this activity, I've just kind of started it in June.
10:12 - Laura: And so we've put estimates based off that.
10:16 - Laura: And one other thing I'll call out that we will be adding in, but do you know what
t-shirt sizing is?
10:23 - Michael Kianmahd: Like specifically, yes.
10:25 - Michael Kianmahd: Not the reference.
10:27 - Laura: Yeah.
10:28 - Laura: So t-shirt sizing in technology means when you put estimates on things, you
basically say this is like an extra small, medium, large, or extra large.
10:39 - Laura: How big is that?
10:40 - Laura: It's literally like, okay, so you tell me, I wanna merge Bl and Tr.
10:44 - Laura: I'm gonna give you a t-shirt estimate without spending the probably like 20
hours to give you an exact estimate I would need to do.
10:52 - Laura: I give you a t-shirt estimate, which tells you that's a large, it equates to about
a hundred hours.
10:58 - Laura: So some organizations have predetermined hours and budgets within that.
11:06 - Laura: Like I work with a client, for example
11:07 - Laura: that if I say extra small
11:10 - Laura: we both know that equates to under four hours
11:12 - Laura: and because they have assigned like an hourly rate
11:15 - Laura: so if it's like 185
11:16 - Laura: they know that would equate to a maximum
11:19 - Laura: of like whatever four times 185 is.
11:21 - Laura: Does that make sense?
11:23 - Michael Kianmahd: I follow.
11:24 - Laura: So almost all of these estimates that you're gonna look at today are pretty
t-shirt sizey, which means that we're like, it's my best guess, but they're not 100%.
11:38 - Laura: It could go either way.
11:40 - Laura: It could be like, it's not gonna take us that much time at all, or it's gonna take
us more.
11:44 - Laura: So you have to take all of that with that in mind.
11:49 - Laura: Okay.
11:49 - Adrian Boerstra: We're gonna make some updates to this that we can call out and
differentiate between sort of t-shirt size projects and fully scoped projects.
11:58 - Laura: Yeah.
12:00 - Laura: Okay.
12:01 - Laura: Okay, so we'll go back to the value streams, just make sure that we have the
right things.
12:05 - Laura: So application intake.
12:06 - Adrian Boerstra: I think Michael had a question there.
12:08 - Michael Kianmahd: Go ahead.
12:09 - Michael Kianmahd: It's okay.
12:10 - Michael Kianmahd: Adrian is your avatar, Laura.
12:15 - Adrian Boerstra: Easy there, girl.
12:19 - Adrian Boerstra: I spoke a ton of German.
12:22 - Michael Kianmahd: Okay, so what lens should I be looking at all this with?
12:28 - Michael Kianmahd: Should I be vocalizing feedback in real time?
12:32 - Michael Kianmahd: Do you want me to wait, take all the information, and then kind
of start at the beginning with feedback?
12:37 - Michael Kianmahd: What would be the most efficient way and most helpful way for
me to provide feedback?
12:42 - Laura: So let's do the value streams now.
12:45 - Laura: do let me go through each value stream and then you feedback and we'll like
when we're happy with application take we'll move on.
12:53 - Laura: If you're referring to like feedback about the like this as a whole, if there's any
questions that you have so that you can understand anything, ask them now otherwise just
kind of like wait until we're at that point.
13:05 - Adrian Boerstra: The big question that we have right now as we go through is just
we'll get through it and just look for any, don't worry about estimates and that stuff.
13:14 - Adrian Boerstra: Just focus on is there a project that you see as a priority that we're
missing.
13:18 - Laura: Yeah.
13:19 - Michael Kianmahd: All right.
13:20 - Michael Kianmahd: I'm just going to keep notes for myself to minimize going in the
weeds.
13:25 - Adrian Boerstra: So yeah, that's perfect.
13:27 - Laura: Yeah.
13:30 - Laura: Pen and paper, like overrated.
13:33 - Michael Kianmahd: Underrated.
13:35 - Adrian Boerstra: Underrated.
13:36 - Laura: Yeah.
13:36 - Laura: Underrated.
13:37 - Laura: I go back to that sometimes, I'm like, sometimes I just want to write a list.
13:41 - Laura: Don't tell.
13:43 - Laura: Okay.
13:44 - Laura: Okay, so Ai-based application intake.
13:50 - Laura: You know what that one is, right?
13:54 - Laura: Yeah.
13:54 - Laura: Okay, perfect.
13:56 - Michael Kianmahd: That's the Gmail Gemini.
13:59 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah, we're like, at this point, we're pretty close to just being able to
beta that, and then it'll be, hey, what do we, As we beta, we'll have feedback and see what we
need to revise on it, but it's pretty much ready.
14:12 - Laura: Okay, so the Penske Partner Api, that's the conversation that we have with
Penske.
14:18 - Michael Kianmahd: Do you want to double click into any of these?
14:22 - Laura: Not really, unless you want me to.
14:25 - Laura: All you're going to see that you don't see here is the estimates, but I feel like
we should just make sure right now that we have the right projects and then we'll go into
ours.
14:37 - Laura: Because if you're looking at the fact that this is like bigger, that doesn't
necessarily equate to the fact that like this is not necessarily going to take more hours than
this one or vice versa.
14:48 - Laura: If that's what you're thinking about, it doesn't work that way.
14:51 - Laura: So let's just keep focusing on the projects and then we'll go back to like
estimates.
14:55 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah.
14:56 - Michael Kianmahd: Okay, so like one of my issues are I'm just like the framework in
my mind
15:06 - Michael Kianmahd: Is impact cost value accountability and priority
15:10 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah, so everything that I'm looking at
15:15 - Michael Kianmahd: Where it ends up on the list is
15:18 - Michael Kianmahd: Partially driven by those five variables and obviously those
variables kind of like relate to each other
15:23 - Michael Kianmahd: So something is like highly impactful low cost high value
15:29 - Michael Kianmahd: There is no accountability risk
15:31 - Michael Kianmahd: It could be prioritized because it's a quick win.
15:34 - Adrian Boerstra: I like that we can incorporate those variables into here directly as
well I know it'd be cool.
15:39 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah, so You know if something is like hugely impactful hugely
expensive very valuable Impossible to have accountability because of the complexity of the
web and interconnections and all that kind of stuff but it's still high priority
15:56 - Michael Kianmahd: that's where budget goes off the rails, right?
15:59 - Michael Kianmahd: Because it's like, who knows what this is gonna cost, but we have
to do it, we have to do it as least expensively as possible.
16:06 - Michael Kianmahd: I'll probably call David Faye a big Dave, come on.
16:14 - Michael Kianmahd: I'm kind of joking, I'm kind of not.
16:16 - Michael Kianmahd: I just feel like that's the framework for which I'm thinking about
this.
16:21 - Adrian Boerstra: So I like that Michael and I'm happy to work that into it.
16:24 - Laura: So for today though, are you able to...
16:28 - Laura: So what I did is I just took a stab and figured that like I just based off previous
conversations that overall like when you factor all those in, it's going to spit out a high,
medium, low.
16:38 - Laura: Can we kind of just work today with prioritizing it as one of those so that we
can like, yeah, does that work?
16:45 - Michael Kianmahd: That totally works.
16:48 - Michael Kianmahd: I guess you do T-shirt sizing, we'll just talk about when I want to
buy the T-shirt.
16:55 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah.
16:57 - Laura: Completely.
16:59 - Laura: The T-shirt sizing should factor into that, because we'll tell you it's an extra
large and then you say, well, I don't really want to do that, so push it out.
17:08 - Michael Kianmahd: Totally.
17:09 - Michael Kianmahd: If you just hover on the Ai-based application intake for a second.
17:13 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah, so Yeah, yeah, this will help me do that.
17:18 - Michael Kianmahd: So it looks like we're like we've gone through half of it.
17:21 - Michael Kianmahd: That's a lot of hours It's like, you know the way if it's 185 an
hour It's like almost a$20,000 investment if everything goes swimmingly It's not a very high
priority for a business because we're over resourced But if it works and it works well
17:44 - Michael Kianmahd: and it automates something that, you know, reduces the amount
of time that it would take a human being to do the work, I would call that high value, medium
cost, medium impact, and I would keep it a medium priority.
18:03 - Michael Kianmahd: Like, that feels like the right thing to me.
18:05 - Michael Kianmahd: But it's not gonna create like a
18:08 - Michael Kianmahd: you know, if we deliver the beta and like the data is like totally
wrong.
18:14 - Michael Kianmahd: And it's like people have to spend more time cleaning it up and
just doing it correctly up front.
18:19 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah.
18:19 - Michael Kianmahd: I probably wouldn't have done it.
18:22 - Michael Kianmahd: So if you can't get it to work and you're 50 hours in and you're
like, listen, this is very complicated.
18:28 - Michael Kianmahd: It's not going to be 100 hours.
18:29 - Michael Kianmahd: It's going to be more.
18:30 - Michael Kianmahd: I probably would deprioritize it and come back to it.
18:33 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah.
18:34 - Adrian Boerstra: Ok.
18:34 - Adrian Boerstra: And my gut on is it's not going to take 100 hours.
18:39 - Adrian Boerstra: I think we're going to be closer to usable in the beta than not.
18:44 - Michael Kianmahd: But you know.
18:45 - Michael Kianmahd: I guess I'm giving you my reaction based on information I'm being
told.
18:51 - Michael Kianmahd: So if the information is not correct and not reliable
18:53 - Michael Kianmahd: and the end state is not actually that great
18:55 - Michael Kianmahd: and there's a bunch of issues, and the goal
18:58 - Michael Kianmahd: is not to get to beta that's imperfect
19:00 - Michael Kianmahd: it was to get to production that's perfect
19:03 - Michael Kianmahd: and we just can't deliver in a reasonable amount of time
19:05 - Michael Kianmahd: frame, I would just say don't do it.
19:07 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah.
19:08 - Michael Kianmahd: I don't want to spend our money there right now.
19:09 - Adrian Boerstra: For sure.
19:10 - Laura: It might be relevant to have a hard stop gap hours or budget on these, Adrian,
so that for projects, for example, we can put a stop gap and just say, don't go over.
19:23 - Adrian Boerstra: Well, we either do that or we just break it up and do a feasibility
project and then do a real project, right?
19:32 - Laura: Yeah.
19:33 - Laura: Ok.
19:34 - Laura: Ok, perfect.
19:35 - Laura: So we're leaving that as a medium.
19:37 - Laura: Was I kind of right on the Penske?
19:40 - Laura: I'll hover so you can see.
19:42 - Laura: Again, it's a guess.
19:43 - Laura: Was I right?
19:44 - Laura: That's a low?
19:46 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah, and I wouldn't, I mean, there's a lot of those.
19:50 - Michael Kianmahd: So I guess the work we do for Penske
19:53 - Michael Kianmahd: I wonder if there's something we can do system-wide
19:56 - Michael Kianmahd: that we can make available to other people
19:57 - Michael Kianmahd: and give them our Api and have them feed us information
20:00 - Michael Kianmahd: the way we want it and make them adjust
20:03 - Michael Kianmahd: not us adjust to them.
20:06 - Michael Kianmahd: So I would I would does that make sense mm-hmm yeah, so like
just and this is me just intuitively like
20:16 - Michael Kianmahd: Trying to determine I don't know if this is possible, but like if
someone's all cleaned up and like they have like an Api and
20:24 - Michael Kianmahd: Their way of connecting to people is
20:28 - Michael Kianmahd: By making them adopt their Api and connect their Api and lift
information from their Api
20:34 - Michael Kianmahd: we can do the same thing.
20:36 - Michael Kianmahd: We can basically say like, here are the hooks, here's information
we want.
20:39 - Michael Kianmahd: Yes.
20:39 - Michael Kianmahd: The data we need to wherever your source is, we don't care how
you do it, but this is how we want it done.
20:45 - Michael Kianmahd: And then maybe over time that lowers our implementation cost
when we have other Apis.
20:50 - Laura: Correct.
20:51 - Laura: This is basically setting up with like a framework.
20:53 - Laura: So doing the Ai, cause we have to basically do that to capture anyways, this
will set us up to do that.
21:00 - Laura: And then we can take the end point that we will have from that.
21:03 - Laura: and then that we've built from Penske, and we can just give it, and then it's
really just them mapping their data into our endpoint.
21:10 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah, I mean, I'm comfortable with how you've categorized it.
21:14 - Laura: Okay, cool.
21:15 - Laura: Okay, so this one here is the ownership and time tracking.
21:20 - Laura: You'll see this one on each one.
21:22 - Laura: This is basically us implementing like the ability to track how people are doing
within that category, right?
21:30 - Laura: And then like be able to hold them accountable.
21:32 - Michael Kianmahd: Is it just submit or is it credit as well?
21:35 - Laura: You're going to see it in every value stream.
21:37 - Laura: They each have their own because they're going to be implemented differently.
21:41 - Laura: There's some objects, things like that, that we actually want to track.
21:44 - Laura: So you're going to see this in each.
21:45 - Laura: I'll hover so you can see.
21:47 - Laura: They'll have similar but slightly different estimates, but they're all they're not
like larges.
21:55 - Laura: They're kind of mediums.
22:01 - Michael Kianmahd: Medium is T-shirt sizing?
22:04 - Laura: Sorry, yes, I meant I wasn't talking about priority.
22:07 - Laura: I was talking like a T-shirt medium.
22:10 - Michael Kianmahd: Medium on the left is priority or no?
22:13 - Laura: It has nothing to do with priority.
22:14 - Laura: That's just the estimate I put on this guy is 38 hours.
22:18 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah, but the yellow medium on the left, is that priority?
22:22 - Laura: Yeah, that's the priority of the project.
22:25 - Michael Kianmahd: So that's the one you're going to tell me.
22:28 - Michael Kianmahd: I would put that, I would put all accountability issues.
22:34 - Michael Kianmahd: Like, if the project itself is a medium, I would keep it a medium.
22:40 - Michael Kianmahd: If anything is a high impact project, then I would just keep
accountability high also.
22:46 - Michael Kianmahd: That makes sense.
22:48 - Laura: No, you want high?
22:51 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah, it's Ok.
22:52 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah, so medium is fine.
22:53 - Laura: Ok.
22:55 - Laura: Okay, perfect.
22:55 - Laura: For application intake, are we missing any projects?
23:02 - Michael Kianmahd: I think data model is part of it, right?
23:05 - Laura: So I've put data model all the way down here in the maintenance because it
basically covers every value stream, so it's in its own.
23:16 - Laura: We can start with that value stream if you'd like, because there's probably a lot
of the things that you're thinking about that are in there, but this is just specific to application
intake.
23:26 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah, let's just go in the order you have it.
23:28 - Michael Kianmahd: So I can't think of anything, and obviously if we do, we'll add that.
23:32 - Laura: Okay, perfect.
23:34 - Laura: Credit underwriting.
23:35 - Michael Kianmahd: I would prevent some of these though.
23:37 - Michael Kianmahd: I would try to get there quicker.
23:40 - Laura: Okay, so that's what we're gonna get to.
23:42 - Laura: Okay.
23:43 - Laura: You're gonna see this.
23:44 - Laura: First, we just need to make sure I've got the right things, right?
23:48 - Laura: Like I just, am I missing a massive project that is gonna need to be factored
in for the hours.
23:53 - Laura: That's all we're really doing here.
23:55 - Laura: So just so you are aware, okay, so the data model is there's like that, and then
there's merging Brtl.
24:05 - Laura: I have split them out so that they can be tracked in the relevant stream.
24:11 - Laura: There's a lot of crossover and there's a lot of like relationship as you would be
aware, but there are very specific like Brtl salesy process stuff that I've split here.
24:24 - Laura: So I did that in Jira as well.
24:26 - Laura: I broke them out so that I could properly estimate those two and I've put them
to start now, but you should be aware that like they are now different.
24:36 - Laura: So when you're looking at the estimate, that is just the merging Brtl.
24:40 - Laura: That is not like the data model.
24:43 - Michael Kianmahd: Got it.
24:44 - Laura: Okay, so I'm gonna go through these.
24:48 - Laura: Merging Br and Tl, I'm assuming that's a high?
24:53 - Michael Kianmahd: It's a high and I would get it done by the end of July.
24:58 - Laura: Okay, scoring enhancements, industries.
25:02 - Laura: I know a lot of this is not actually on us.
25:05 - Laura: A lot of it is Kin.
25:08 - Laura: Actually, those hours aren't right, hang on.
25:13 - Michael Kianmahd: I don't think it's much work for Fay.
25:17 - Laura: Yeah, Adrian, are you there by chance?
25:22 - Adrian Boerstra: Yes, I'm back.
25:24 - Adrian Boerstra: The car I had in Rochester just sold, so.
25:30 - Adrian Boerstra: My blue car.
25:32 - Laura: Oh, okay.
25:33 - Michael Kianmahd: You lived in Rochester?
25:34 - Adrian Boerstra: No, so I bought a Lotus.
25:38 - Adrian Boerstra: I ordered it in Denver, went back to Denver to pick it up, and ran into
trouble bringing it back into Canada.
25:45 - Adrian Boerstra: And I ended up selling it through a consignment shop in Rochester.
25:49 - Adrian Boerstra: So they just called me with an offer.
25:52 - Michael Kianmahd: What kind of Lotus?
25:53 - Adrian Boerstra: Lotus Amira.
25:55 - Michael Kianmahd: Nice.
25:56 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah.
25:57 - Adrian Boerstra: It's fun.
26:00 - Adrian Boerstra: Had it for a year.
26:04 - Laura: I've never heard of that before.
26:08 - Adrian Boerstra: I had the blue one.
26:11 - Laura: Okay, question for you.
26:12 - Laura: I just realized that I was like, this is the hover.
26:15 - Laura: It says total hours 89, but I've only put 20 with the overage, which is equates
to 24.
26:25 - Adrian Boerstra: Oh, okay.
26:27 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah, I made changes to the calculation.
26:31 - Adrian Boerstra: So it was since I did the hover, so I may need to just touch up.
26:33 - Laura: Okay, so I'll just go into the, Michael, what the hover was, what's not correct.
26:38 - Laura: So the scoring I've just put, there should be 24 hours and this one is also.
26:44 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah, you know what, can you just refresh your screen?
26:51 - Laura: It's gonna, okay.
26:54 - Adrian Boerstra: It shouldn't change your data, but.
26:56 - Laura: Yeah, let me go here.
27:02 - Laura: And show correct, Ok.
27:07 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah, Ok, there you go.
27:08 - Laura: I already fixed it.
27:10 - Laura: I was like it shouldn't be that long.
27:11 - Laura: Ok, so merging Br&t L130 scoring enhancements 20 will need to support kin
in some way, shape or form, and that's likely like those industries.
27:23 - Laura: Those are both high, right?
27:26 - Laura: Yeah.
27:27 - Michael Kianmahd: So then here is you should move it though.
27:31 - Michael Kianmahd: Move.
27:32 - Laura: I will I'll get there.
27:34 - Laura: I promise.
27:34 - Michael Kianmahd: I know you're on.
27:37 - Adrian Boerstra: You know you can drag those.
27:40 - Adrian Boerstra: What's that, you know you can drag those up and down.
27:44 - Adrian Boerstra: drag whatever.
27:45 - Adrian Boerstra: Did you mean you need to like, we need to move the project out
further?
27:49 - Laura: No, he wants it like that.
27:52 - Adrian Boerstra: Oh, okay.
27:53 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah, yeah.
27:53 - Michael Kianmahd: Adrian, Laura is my avatar.
27:57 - Laura: We all need one.
28:01 - Laura: Okay, so, okay, I'm getting there.
28:03 - Laura: So this is the credit underwriting, ownership and time tracking, and then the
automated approval processes.
28:09 - Laura: Those are more like the credit buckets.
28:12 - Laura: So you're only going to see that one in credit.
28:15 - Laura: I'll hover.
28:17 - Laura: So about 40 hours and then the time tracking is about 30.
28:21 - Laura: Are those medium priorities?
28:23 - Laura: Just like the application intake one, let's submit.
28:27 - Michael Kianmahd: Time tracking high.
28:29 - Michael Kianmahd: Okay.
28:30 - Michael Kianmahd: Automated low.
28:32 - Laura: Okay.
28:35 - Michael Kianmahd: These are priorities, right?
28:37 - Laura: Yeah.
28:38 - Laura: That's helpful, thank you.
28:40 - Laura: No problem.
28:42 - Laura: Okay.
28:44 - Laura: And then sales tax, that's been on the radar since I think my like very first day.
28:50 - Laura: I put it low because nobody else has said anything about it.
28:53 - Michael Kianmahd: We don't really have a problem with it.
28:57 - Michael Kianmahd: And it's more of a servicing issue.
28:59 - Michael Kianmahd: It's kind of a credit issue, you could leave it on credit, I would leave
it as low.
29:04 - Michael Kianmahd: And I would.
29:07 - Michael Kianmahd: It's like.
29:10 - Michael Kianmahd: I heard actually a crazy story From a Coo candidate and he
worked at this firm.
29:18 - Michael Kianmahd: It was a used to be public and then fortress bought it and
29:23 - Michael Kianmahd: they changed their systems and there was like double billing and
29:27 - Michael Kianmahd: under collection of sales tax or over collection of sales tax
because their system was totally fucked up and
29:34 - Michael Kianmahd: Then they ended up getting sued and it ended up becoming
29:36 - Michael Kianmahd: coming.
29:37 - Michael Kianmahd: It was like such a big number because it went on for so long.
29:41 - Michael Kianmahd: And there were so many refunds due and the state was out
money.
29:45 - Michael Kianmahd: It was like so crazy.
29:48 - Michael Kianmahd: They need to pay the state.
29:50 - Michael Kianmahd: They needed to pay back customers.
29:52 - Michael Kianmahd: And it was like really bad.
29:54 - Michael Kianmahd: The company ended up saying, you know what, let's just fire
everybody and just run off the portfolio and take the proceeds and pay the government and
pay the customers and just like be done.
30:04 - Michael Kianmahd: They're basically winding it down.
30:06 - Michael Kianmahd: Everyone left Ceo left Ceo left Cfo left
30:12 - Michael Kianmahd: So like I think while it's a low priority if we get that wrong and we
like overbill people and underpay We understand what we're doing like system wise and like
nobody catches it because like nobody really sees in there's no accountability.
30:27 - Michael Kianmahd: That's the business risk Okay
30:31 - Michael Kianmahd: That would keep me up at night.
30:33 - Michael Kianmahd: Like, you know, like we missed something obvious and basic.
30:38 - Laura: Okay.
30:40 - Laura: Does that still sit in a low then for you?
30:42 - Laura: Or?
30:43 - Michael Kianmahd: I feel like it's...
30:45 - Adrian Boerstra: It does bring up another factor though, doesn't it?
30:48 - Michael Kianmahd: Risk.
30:49 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah, I'm gonna add that.
30:51 - Michael Kianmahd: That's a really good point.
30:52 - Laura: Maybe more like a medium.
30:56 - Laura: So I don't even know if these are the same things
30:59 - Laura: Cause sales tax I know has quite a few like places that it's important
31:04 - Laura: but just from sitting with users when I was there and how like just watching J
31:11 - Laura: toggle between Salesforce and Google sheets and different websites
31:14 - Laura: like just to get all the different sales tax was just a big time killer too.
31:19 - Michael Kianmahd: Which is way, yeah.
31:22 - Michael Kianmahd: Call it a medium and move it, move it.
31:24 - Michael Kianmahd: Like it's something that we should deal with when we're dealing
with everything, You know?
31:29 - Laura: Yeah.
31:30 - Adrian Boerstra: Okay.
31:30 - Adrian Boerstra: So maybe you have more April or whatever.
31:32 - Michael Kianmahd: So I added risk as a variable.
31:35 - Michael Kianmahd: I have operational, regulation, financial, and liability.
31:39 - Michael Kianmahd: I probably should add reputational as well.
32:09 - Laura: to get it in a state where it's fully like replaced the funding checklist.
32:14 - Laura: That's what this is.
32:15 - Michael Kianmahd: Why are we not over the hump yet?
32:18 - Laura: So I know I'm gonna schedule a call with you and Juan for early next week
and whoever else he wants there to review, because we're at this stage now where he's like
used it enough.
32:27 - Laura: I need to get the other users using it.
32:29 - Laura: We wanna roll it out to the other dealers and brokers and stuff, but there are
like little bits and bobs or bigger sort of add-ons that we want that need to be prioritized and
kind of account for.
32:41 - Laura: So that's really what this is representing.
32:43 - Laura: It'll basically stretch over the next like few months because getting any sort
of like new process will take that kind of effort.
32:53 - Laura: I've given it a like ballpark, very high level because it will, there are things that
will be there that don't exist today.
32:59 - Laura: So I took a guess.
33:01 - Adrian Boerstra: And maybe as we tighten up on what the specific enhancements
and features are, one of the things that I suggested to Laura is let's not make any project
span more than three months.
33:12 - Adrian Boerstra: If it's gonna span more than a quarter, then let's break it up into
smaller ones so we can sort of have clear deliverables and...
33:21 - Laura: Yeah, okay, perfect.
33:22 - Laura: And then docs, ownership and time tracking.
33:25 - Laura: Is that medium?
33:27 - Laura: That's high.
33:28 - Laura: That's a high.
33:30 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah, Aio enhancements are a high as well, sorry.
33:33 - Laura: I was, no, thank you.
33:34 - Laura: I was just gonna go back there.
33:36 - Michael Kianmahd: Missed sections.
33:38 - Michael Kianmahd: Do you have anything else on documentation?
33:40 - Laura: I don't.
33:42 - Laura: Am I missing anything?
33:44 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah.
33:46 - Michael Kianmahd: Ok.
33:46 - Michael Kianmahd: It's on the unified doc format, Docusign, enotary.
33:50 - Laura: I put enotary under funding.
33:53 - Laura: Is that the wrong one?
33:58 - Michael Kianmahd: I mean, technically, no.
33:59 - Michael Kianmahd: I mean, I group docs and funding together.
34:02 - Michael Kianmahd: So to me, like Conga.
34:09 - Laura: Are you specifically referring to Conga and dock, like the merging Brtl and
getting those like single docks?
34:18 - Laura: Or are you referring to something else?
34:20 - Michael Kianmahd: I'm talking about that.
34:22 - Michael Kianmahd: Plus getting docs drafted super efficiently.
34:25 - Laura: Okay.
34:26 - Laura: So I have all of that.
34:28 - Laura: merging Brtl stuff, I have it under credit writing.
34:32 - Laura: Because that's where it most closely aligns.
34:35 - Laura: It's really like a J.
34:36 - Laura: Charles process.
34:37 - Laura: Most of it's in there.
34:38 - Laura: It will have overlap.
34:41 - Michael Kianmahd: Do you have like that, like if you click on that, and how many
projects are in there?
34:47 - Laura: That's it.
34:48 - Laura: This is just very high level.
34:50 - Michael Kianmahd: It's not specific enough?
34:52 - Laura: Okay.
34:55 - Michael Kianmahd: So how many hours do you have total for that?
34:58 - Michael Kianmahd: 130.
34:59 - Laura: So what's included in that?
35:00 - Laura: This is not data model though.
35:01 - Laura: That's not data model.
35:02 - Laura: What's included in that?
35:04 - Laura: So that has to do with, so there's the sales process, which is like actually
getting in the system, like your record types, the sales stages, cleaning up the data, and then
it's all of the, the Conga, the Docusign, and it's updating all of those solutions.
35:22 - Laura: So creating Conga solutions, things like that.
35:25 - Michael Kianmahd: Mm-hmm.
35:26 - Michael Kianmahd: I feel like what I would do is I would break that out
35:32 - Michael Kianmahd: Because that's all like
35:36 - Michael Kianmahd: Merging Bl and Tr is too meta and then you know visibility and
you forget what you're trying to do and then
35:44 - Michael Kianmahd: Like we end up focusing on the wrong thing
35:46 - Michael Kianmahd: And then it just doesn't get done in the way it should get done
or the sequence it should get done
35:49 - Michael Kianmahd: and then it just risks the project.
35:52 - Michael Kianmahd: So what I would do is I would break out each of those things very
specifically.
35:57 - Laura: Ok.
35:58 - Laura: The only reason I grouped them together is because you kind of have to, like
the way that the system is built right now, there's not really a way to separate them.
36:07 - Laura: They kind of have to be done.
36:10 - Adrian Boerstra: I have another idea around that.
36:13 - Adrian Boerstra: Why don't we create that temporary merging Bl and Tr value stream
and then break it down within there because there are going to be specific miles.
36:24 - Adrian Boerstra: I mean, actually, we don't even have to do that.
36:25 - Adrian Boerstra: So we do have milestones that we haven't been really using here
within the merging Bl and Tr.
36:32 - Adrian Boerstra: Maybe we just define what Michael, the breakdown that Michael's
talking about in milestones.
36:38 - Michael Kianmahd: I think, Laura, you have all of them, right, already?
36:41 - Laura: So this is like, I have Jira and Jira has the Epic and there's a bunch of stories
and tasks in there.
36:48 - Laura: And then all I've done here as like a Pm like portfolio tool is I've literally just
said all of like all of my sub data and tasks and stuff equate to about 130 hours.
36:59 - Laura: Here it is.
37:00 - Laura: That's the project.
37:03 - Adrian Boerstra: There is a view in here, Michael, that we haven't shown you yet.
37:06 - Adrian Boerstra: Remember we were talking about rocks before?
37:08 - Michael Kianmahd: more.
37:09 - Adrian Boerstra: So, I added a planning tool in here so that as we identify rocks by
value stream for each quarter, this will overlap it so that you can see what milestones are
coming within the same quarter on the projects that we've already scoped in that are going
on.
37:25 - Adrian Boerstra: So if we said, okay, what are the most important things for this
quarter to actually accomplish, the rocks would be putting it in a business context.
37:35 - Adrian Boerstra: And this, you're not selecting the
37:38 - Adrian Boerstra: The Milestones Just will Automatically show up any Milestones
that, We have Times to happen Within that Quarter
37:46 - Michael Kianmahd: Will Automatically Show up on that Planning Page so here's
Here's what I would suggest
37:52 - Michael Kianmahd: Sure I would suggest
37:55 - Michael Kianmahd: Like the more the more sort of Single I?
38:00 - Michael Kianmahd: Don't know if This is Possible Between like Jira and github
38:04 - Michael Kianmahd: But if You have like all These Subtasks
38:07 - Michael Kianmahd: and they sit under the merging Bl&tr project
38:11 - Michael Kianmahd: it would be really nice to double click
38:13 - Michael Kianmahd: on the major project, see the subtasks
38:16 - Michael Kianmahd: and then see how many hours are allocated for subtasks.
38:19 - Laura: Okay, so we'll give you, like that's not really what this is for.
38:24 - Michael Kianmahd: Okay.
38:25 - Laura: We are gonna give you a view of that.
38:27 - Laura: I have like a, we've got the external share for Jira ready to go, so I can like, I
can give that to you separately.
38:32 - Laura: This is really just like, what are the high level initiatives that we're trying to
achieve?
38:39 - Adrian Boerstra: So that I can do that.
38:39 - Adrian Boerstra: So it's a planning level conversation.
38:42 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah.
38:42 - Michael Kianmahd: What's that?
38:45 - Michael Kianmahd: What was that?
38:45 - Michael Kianmahd: You guys are talking at the same time.
38:47 - Adrian Boerstra: No, I just, this is more just for facilitating the planning conversation,
but it's not where we manage the project.
38:53 - Laura: Yeah.
38:55 - Laura: Okay, so let's keep going because we've only got 20 minutes before our call
with David.
39:00 - Laura: I really want to get to the drag park.
39:02 - Laura: I know Michael's excited for that.
39:03 - Laura: So let's just go through the projects, do priorities, and then if we need to move
them around, you and I can do that separately, Michael.
39:11 - Laura: Okay, so documentation, and just do pretend that docs and funding are
together.
39:16 - Laura: There will be the Aio enhancements, there's enotary, and then there's like the
ownership and time tracking of those two processes.
39:28 - Laura: So again, when you say doc, you sign, Are you referring to streamlining
Docusign so that when we have our new opportunities, it's more streamlined where you can
just say like send contract?
39:44 - Laura: Okay.
39:45 - Laura: So then we just need to push past that.
39:47 - Laura: That's currently reflected in credit underwriting.
39:50 - Laura: That's the merging Brtl.
39:51 - Laura: I will go away and I'll break that out later.
39:54 - Laura: It's not reflected here.
39:56 - Laura: Unless there's something else specific to documentation or funding that we
need to.
39:59 - Michael Kianmahd: That specific thing is a documentation and funding thing.
40:03 - Michael Kianmahd: Ok, so I'll move that over later.
40:05 - Michael Kianmahd: It's not a credit thing, just to delineate between.
40:10 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah, so if it's important for you to be disciplined about what
value stream it fits in, the correct value stream for it to fit it in, like Congo would be docs,
Docusign would be funding, enotary would be funding.
40:30 - Adrian Boerstra: Okay, so I'll do that.
40:33 - Michael Kianmahd: I really want to push this past because we need to get to the
point.
40:37 - Laura: So have I missed anything critical within docs and funding?
40:42 - Laura: Outside of my docusign?
40:46 - Michael Kianmahd: Not that I can think of in the context of the conversation we're
having.
40:50 - Laura: Okay, perfect.
40:51 - Laura: So is the ownership and time tracking for funding, is that high as well?
40:57 - Laura: Or should I just end up combining them?
40:59 - Michael Kianmahd: high.
41:00 - Laura: Okay.
41:01 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah.
41:02 - Michael Kianmahd: Let's move that to high.
41:05 - Laura: Perfect.
41:06 - Laura: And then e-notary, is that a medium?
41:08 - Michael Kianmahd: It's a high.
41:09 - Laura: It's a high.
41:10 - Laura: Okay.
41:13 - Laura: Perfect.
41:15 - Laura: Okay.
41:16 - Laura: And then servicing and collections.
41:18 - Laura: I know you do have a lot of ownership and time tracking already established
for that.
41:22 - Laura: So I just took a guess that we would probably still want something if I'm wrong.
41:26 - Michael Kianmahd: Recording is not automated.
41:29 - Laura: Okay.
41:30 - Michael Kianmahd: It's manually done.
41:31 - Michael Kianmahd: It's human error prone.
41:33 - Michael Kianmahd: It's not in real time.
41:40 - Michael Kianmahd: This calls a bigger discussion.
41:42 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah.
41:43 - Michael Kianmahd: I am totally comfortable with us not attacking it at this moment.
41:53 - Michael Kianmahd: No, I would keep it in November.
41:55 - Michael Kianmahd: Okie dokie.
41:56 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah.
41:57 - Michael Kianmahd: I mean the sooner we do it, the better off we'll be, but it's not the
greatest source of pain in the business today.
42:07 - Laura: Should I just leave it as a medium then?
42:37 - Michael Kianmahd: of problems and the only way you can know that you have a
problem is if you're measuring things properly.
42:44 - Michael Kianmahd: So my hack on discovering where the limitations are in the
business operationally and whether someone is failing because they suck, not because it's
a rig game against them, by tracking.
42:56 - Michael Kianmahd: So what gets measured gets managed in some capacity and I
just wanna prioritize that for us.
43:03 - Laura: Okay, love it.
43:05 - Laura: Okay, and then I have here like a Ux optimization.
43:09 - Laura: You're going to see this for servicing and collections and for sales.
43:13 - Laura: This is what Hebert has been asking for and is it's like just basically restruc-
turing their like views and objects and records to like present the information and streamline
that process.
43:27 - Laura: It's not a huge one, it's just something that needs to be done.
43:35 - Michael Kianmahd: Fine.
43:36 - Laura: Okay, is it good to set a medium?
43:40 - Michael Kianmahd: I mean, you have better insight, but like, if it makes everybody
just do a better job because everything's, then I would call it high, you know?
43:50 - Adrian Boerstra: I'm noticing, by the way, no, sorry, I shouldn't say anything because
we're not there yet.
43:56 - Laura: Okay.
43:57 - Laura: Almost done guys.
43:58 - Laura: We're gonna get to the slidey part.
44:00 - Laura: Exciting.
44:01 - Laura: Okay, so client broker dealer relationship.
44:04 - Laura: Same thing here.
44:05 - Michael Kianmahd: This is like the lead conversion.
44:08 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah, broker application low.
44:11 - Laura: Okay.
44:13 - Michael Kianmahd: Like Salesforce Ux optimization for sales is low.
44:17 - Michael Kianmahd: I wanna fix the operating aspect of our business before we invest
in sales.
44:20 - Michael Kianmahd: Anything that's like, I think sales will be helped by service and
making the sales person more efficient today is not my top concern.
44:31 - Laura: Okay, perfect.
44:33 - Laura: Okay, so product and program innovation.
44:35 - Laura: So the box automated dock storage, is that immediate?
44:41 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah.
44:42 - Michael Kianmahd: So I met with the owners of Info Networks this week.
44:48 - Michael Kianmahd: Okay.
44:49 - Michael Kianmahd: and they are friends of mine.
44:54 - Michael Kianmahd: So I guess one strategic question is should we keep using them?
45:00 - Michael Kianmahd: So that's one thing on the table.
45:02 - Michael Kianmahd: If we decide to keep using them, how do we make sure that they
meet our service needs?
45:09 - Michael Kianmahd: And the third is, if they can meet our service needs, what kind of
strategic value can they add to us?
45:18 - Michael Kianmahd: So I started that conversation, and one of the things that came
up in the conversation was us switching to Microsoft.
45:28 - Michael Kianmahd: So if we switch to Microsoft
45:33 - Michael Kianmahd: which I'm kind of like, yeah.
45:36 - Michael Kianmahd: So I just like, let me get your take on that.
45:39 - Michael Kianmahd: Because if we switch to Microsoft, the Box project goes away,
right?
45:46 - Laura: How?
45:48 - Michael Kianmahd: We would use Sharepoint or Onedrive, right?
45:52 - Laura: Oh.
45:53 - Michael Kianmahd: Probably.
45:55 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah, because I think one of the things they're telling me is
access.
46:00 - Michael Kianmahd: It's like once you get above, are you guys Microsoft or Google?
46:03 - Adrian Boerstra: Microsoft.
46:05 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah, so my brother is like, you don't realize how much produc-
tivity you're losing not being on Microsoft.
46:13 - Michael Kianmahd: Anything from calendar invites to like, Microsoft Teams is way
better.
46:20 - Michael Kianmahd: You know, Google's kind of feels more consumery, it's like more
limited, there's less keyboard shortcuts.
46:30 - Michael Kianmahd: You know, it sounds like Microsoft is like beating Google in the
cloud, especially for corporate use cases with like Azure.
46:41 - Michael Kianmahd: What else did he tell me?
46:43 - Michael Kianmahd: So that's not a decision we have to make today.
46:48 - Michael Kianmahd: So yeah, box costs us like 10 grand a year basically.
46:53 - Michael Kianmahd: It's not a huge cost.
46:56 - Adrian Boerstra: I'll say this, there are different people.
46:59 - Adrian Boerstra: I personally, I prefer Google over Microsoft, but Microsoft, where
Microsoft made this is going down a whole other road.
47:11 - Adrian Boerstra: I don't think it's I don't think to I wouldn't suggest that getting off of
Google is like an obvious thing.
47:20 - Adrian Boerstra: But Microsoft, like, Microsoft gives a lot of tools that are pretty good
within their suite.
47:29 - Adrian Boerstra: And it's hard to beat that deal.
47:33 - Adrian Boerstra: But when you go down the road with that road with Microsoft.
47:38 - Adrian Boerstra: To really get the value, there's a lot of cases where, in my opinion,
you're using tools that are not as good as like what are otherwise available.
47:52 - Adrian Boerstra: Um, yeah, I, I find Microsoft for a lot of things not to be best of breed.
47:56 - Adrian Boerstra: but it's unquestionable value if you just are like, well, I don't need
best of breed, but this is good enough and it's got a lot of good stuff.
48:08 - Michael Kianmahd: The other thing I want to avoid is the distraction of spending a
bunch of time and effort switching to something, having to reprogram calendar invites, los-
ing everything in Google Drive and migrating that over, losing Box and migrating everything
over.
48:28 - Michael Kianmahd: or it just seems like a distraction, but the gut check question that
I'm asking is like, is it that much more valuable?
48:35 - Michael Kianmahd: And if not, it's a moot, right?
48:36 - Adrian Boerstra: And don't- Yeah, and just top of the envelope, like my thought, I don't
think it's that, I don't think there's a lot of value in moving over to Microsoft for you.
48:47 - Michael Kianmahd: Okay, so then box stays and eight by eight stays and duplicate
management stays, I could add.
48:54 - Adrian Boerstra: If we wanna allocate a little bit of time to that question, I could do
a study for you, but I don't know.
49:00 - Adrian Boerstra: My gut is no.
49:01 - Laura: Yeah, I would say.
49:02 - Laura: You're not gonna get the same level of document storage with the Sharepoint
Onenote within Salesforce that you will with Box.
49:08 - Laura: You basically can't do this one in the same, you'd need like an integration tool
to do it.
49:14 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah, basically what I would, the only sort of like, if I take a step
back and like reflecting on the organizational structure and that I mentioned that, you know,
I view like Info Networks, Faye, and Kin as like an extension of our team.
49:29 - Michael Kianmahd: To what extent do you think Faye could add strategic value in
that conversation?
49:35 - Michael Kianmahd: Should I do it offline like this and then report back to them?
49:38 - Michael Kianmahd: Should you be at the table when we're talking?
49:42 - Michael Kianmahd: You know, that's just a high level question.
49:43 - Michael Kianmahd: But you gave me the answer I was looking for.
49:45 - Michael Kianmahd: So like, I'm basically gonna say like, we're sticking to Google,
we're sticking to Box, we're not moving to Microsoft.
49:50 - Michael Kianmahd: Let's plan accordingly.
49:53 - Adrian Boerstra: So, yeah.
49:55 - Adrian Boerstra: If you were to ask Ross that same question, Ross would probably
be like, oh, a hundred percent you should go to Microsoft.
50:02 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah.
50:03 - Michael Kianmahd: There's no right answer, right?
50:04 - Adrian Boerstra: I'm just, yeah, there's no, yeah.
50:06 - Adrian Boerstra: I don't think it's like a real clear value proposition.
50:09 - Adrian Boerstra: And if I was to start up my company again today, I'd do it on Google
again.
50:16 - Laura: Okay.
50:17 - Laura: So let's- Yeah, I'm impartial and I would say, don't move.
50:21 - Laura: your migration costs alone will just create chaos.
50:25 - Laura: I don't feel like there's, yeah.
50:31 - Laura: Okay, good priorities.
50:33 - Laura: I'm trying to now I'm speeding.
50:35 - Laura: So we've got here under maintenance, you've got your data model refresh, no
surprise there.
50:40 - Laura: I put that as a high, I'm assuming, and I've stretched it.
50:45 - Laura: We're already starting on that one.
50:47 - Laura: I've added this in.
50:49 - Laura: There are things that are going to come up in me trying to get your data model
and then I'm going to need to do some cleanup.
50:56 - Michael Kianmahd: That doesn't make sense.
50:58 - Michael Kianmahd: It's one month, 160 hours.
51:02 - Laura: Well, so this is basically a lot of the data model refresh is like, me planning and
me creating thing in sandbox, but in prep for the data.
51:13 - Laura: Do you remember the call that we had on Monday where I took you through
your account types?
51:17 - Laura: And I said, yeah, so when I do things like data cleanup and all of the things
that are needed for it, I'm going to need to go in and fix stuff or find stuff out so that I can
control it in order to do things like update data to prep it for the data model.
51:38 - Laura: So, an example of that is you've got how many workflows on opportunities
that could trigger
51:44 - Laura: if I go in and update data and clean up your, like your opportunity data and
your vehicle
51:49 - Laura: data, and I don't know if those triggers will cause an email alert to fire or will
cause
51:55 - Laura: something else to update.
51:58 - Laura: So without actually doing some of that prep work, I'll get stuck on doing a lot
of the things I need to do with the data model refresh.
52:07 - Laura: Does that make sense?
52:08 - Laura: I've stripped it out into its own because it's not actually like fixing your data
model.
52:14 - Laura: It is separate, but it's kind of one of those things that there are certain things
that I'm going to need to like fix and unwind.
52:23 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah, is it, I mean, the obvious question is, is it really 160 hours
in one month?
52:30 - Laura: It's a, well, so here, okay, so we're at the draggy part because we're at the
bottom.
52:33 - Laura: First, before we do that, have I missed anything?
52:36 - Adrian Boerstra: I'm gonna work that into the help documentation for this.
52:41 - Laura: All right, I'm for you, I'm gonna be very professional.
52:43 - Adrian Boerstra: Although I kind of like the slidey part better.
52:45 - Laura: The slidey part.
52:47 - Laura: So have I missed any projects that are, have I missed any projects to start?
52:55 - Michael Kianmahd: I don't think so.
52:56 - Michael Kianmahd: But again, like my challenge with this is like, what's under the
surface?
53:01 - Michael Kianmahd: And if there's a bunch of things that are critical under the surface
and missing, that's a problem.
53:06 - Laura: Oh, Adrian, we're...
53:08 - Laura: My, sorry, I am missing one.
53:11 - Laura: I have the regular, that's why it's so, so hang on.
53:15 - Michael Kianmahd: Regular.
53:16 - Adrian Boerstra: Is it just off the page?
53:17 - Adrian Boerstra: Did you create it already or?
53:20 - Laura: No, I think when I refreshed for some reason it didn't like stick.
53:25 - Laura: Today, and I go to.
53:30 - Adrian Boerstra: Because you don't have show all on, just in case you have it in an
area of the.
53:34 - Laura: Oh.
53:37 - Laura: Oh, hey, look at that.
53:41 - Laura: No, it, yeah, no, it was missing.
53:44 - Adrian Boerstra: Okay
53:46 - Laura: give me a sec here.
53:47 - Laura: So this is just your like regular maintenance.
53:49 - Laura: So like when one of your users needs support or we have a little like feature,
we wanna fix the layout.
53:55 - Laura: This is just like sort of your like regular acts, yeah.
53:58 - Michael Kianmahd: 10 hours a month?
54:01 - Laura: Yeah, I, well, I put it at eight hours a week.
54:04 - Laura: So, it was 416 and then we don't need overage, but that gets stretched out to
8.
54:12 - Laura: So, it'd be like 30 hours a month, 32.
54:17 - Laura: But that's also like meetings, like it's all of these conversations, it's like time
tracking, it's going in and you need a new user, it's like permission, it's all that stuff.
54:28 - Laura: Okay, so there's that.
54:30 - Laura: Have I missed any other projects?
54:33 - Laura: No.
54:34 - Laura: Okay, so slide apart.
54:39 - Laura: I'm think it doesn't make sense to like, move the highs kind of closer to the
now and then move some of the lows, and like, move them out of it so we can get.
54:49 - Michael Kianmahd: Let me, let me just check.
54:52 - Laura: Okay.
54:55 - Michael Kianmahd: I just want to make sure.
55:01 - Adrian Boerstra: You might, Laura, want to start, do your starting month as May, just
so that you don't lose the start of a project, because otherwise they don't track properly.
55:11 - Laura: Okay, thank you.
55:13 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah, Laura, come on.
55:15 - Adrian Boerstra: I'm the avatar now.
55:19 - Laura: So bossy.
55:21 - Laura: We can also just give Dave maybe this meat, instead of having to hop off and
just hop on for him.
55:29 - Adrian Boerstra: I'll give him this.
55:31 - Adrian Boerstra: He and Caleb can just jump on with us here.
55:33 - Laura: Oh yeah, Caleb, yeah.
55:35 - Laura: Yeah, because we can just keep going with this conversation.
55:38 - Laura: This is really what we'll talk about anyways.
55:42 - Laura: Just let me know when you're ready, Michael.
55:43 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah, I'm just looking at everything.
55:57 - Michael Kianmahd: Did you talk about servicing at all?
56:01 - Laura: So, we have just like servicing and collections.
56:05 - Laura: Okay, like that in the back end stuff.
56:14 - Laura: I didn't put anything on here in like lease works or anything like that.
56:31 - Michael Kianmahd: Okay, I think we're good.
56:33 - Laura: Okay.
56:36 - Laura: Okay, so how does it make sense for me to sort of arrange them a little bit
more now that we've prioritized and just kind of drag things out or?
56:45 - Michael Kianmahd: Can you send me the link to this so I could see it?
56:48 - Laura: Yep.
56:49 - Laura: You will have to.
56:51 - Michael Kianmahd: Can I just log in as you or something?
56:54 - Laura: Oops.
56:55 - Laura: Hang on.
56:57 - Laura: So Adrian, I just send in the link and then he just has to import, right?
57:01 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah.
57:02 - Laura: Okay.
57:04 - Laura: Sorry, I'm just trying to find a chat.
57:05 - Laura: I can never find the chat in this Lower right-hand corner.
57:09 - Adrian Boerstra: Thank you Michael this tool doesn't have like a database behind it
57:14 - Adrian Boerstra: everything is just like locally cached in your browser because it's
really just for
57:19 - Adrian Boerstra: building up scenarios
57:20 - Adrian Boerstra: So she's sending you a file that you just need to import in and then
you'll be but it doesn't it won't
57:26 - Adrian Boerstra: You can build your own scenarios and change things all you want
57:31 - Laura: Give me a sec here.
57:33 - Laura: I'm going to just stop presenting.
57:34 - Laura: I'm going to, I can't send you the file over chat, so I'm going to go and can I
just Google chat you that?
57:42 - Michael Kianmahd: Do whatever you like.
57:48 - Adrian Boerstra: Now who's the avatar?
57:52 - Michael Kianmahd: I lost track.
57:55 - Adrian Boerstra: Ok
57:58 - Laura: so you can go to the link that I provided and then I just.
58:03 - Adrian Boerstra: I've been your chat will not be tolerated.
58:09 - Laura: Oh, they're going to love you in German.
58:12 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah.
58:13 - Michael Kianmahd: Before I import this?
58:15 - Laura: Yeah.
58:15 - Laura: So go into the files and then just click import Json and then just import that
file that I just sent you in chat.
58:23 - Adrian Boerstra: You think it'll be a problem when I order food at a restaurant like an
angry Nazi?
58:28 - Michael Kianmahd: Don't do that, Adrian.
58:29 - Laura: As long as your arms fall.
58:32 - Adrian Boerstra: I'll take that one!
58:36 - Adrian Boerstra: Do not do that.
58:40 - Laura: They take it really seriously.
58:44 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah, if I do that, saying just joking afterwards is not going to make
it better.
58:49 - Adrian Boerstra: Is that what you're telling me?
58:51 - Laura: Oh, no, it will.
58:52 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah.
58:52 - Adrian Boerstra: Oh, yeah, I'll be fine.
58:54 - Laura: Yeah, I'll be fine.
58:54 - Adrian Boerstra: You tell me how that goes.
58:59 - Michael Kianmahd: When are you back?
59:01 - Adrian Boerstra: Is it like after the first?
59:02 - Adrian Boerstra: No, like first work day back is June 30th.
59:10 - Laura: Oh, you're not taking that off for Canada Day?
59:13 - Adrian Boerstra: Is that a Canada Day holiday?
59:15 - Laura: June 30th?
59:15 - Adrian Boerstra: Well, the Tuesday is, but I think I'm taking it on now.
59:18 - Adrian Boerstra: Oh yeah, I didn't even think of that.
59:20 - Adrian Boerstra: Could have stayed longer.
59:21 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah.
59:22 - Adrian Boerstra: Hi Dave.
59:24 - Adrian Boerstra: Hey Dave.
59:25 - Dave Kaplan: Hello.
59:27 - Dave Kaplan: I don't know if I have allergies or something, but I feel like crap, so I'm
gonna do very little talking and let you guys drive.
59:34 - Laura: Not a worry.
59:35 - Laura: We're at the fun part.
59:36 - Laura: We're about to do some sliding, so you can just enjoy the show.
59:40 - Adrian Boerstra: I think Dave needs more context to understand what back where
we were.
59:45 - Laura: It's better without the context.
59:52 - Adrian Boerstra: We like to have fun here.
59:54 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah.
59:55 - Michael Kianmahd: Is it working?
59:58 - Michael Kianmahd: No, I uploaded it, but it's not working.
01:00:00 - Michael Kianmahd: So I'll just, I don't want to hold it up.
01:00:04 - Michael Kianmahd: So let's just move forward.
01:00:07 - Laura: Okay.
01:00:11 - Michael Kianmahd: So any project that started, you're going to move to May, is
that right?
01:00:15 - Laura: Well, May has already happened.
01:00:17 - Laura: Oh, Adrian was just saying that I should show it so that if we started.
01:00:22 - Adrian Boerstra: If the start of the project is outside the viewable range, it doesn't
drag the whole thing.
01:00:28 - Adrian Boerstra: It just, yeah.
01:00:30 - Michael Kianmahd: Okay, what's the 143% thing?
01:00:34 - Laura: Oh, so this is a completed one.
01:00:36 - Laura: This is why I didn't have mage.
01:00:38 - Laura: And I don't know if it'll just like move that out.
01:00:41 - Laura: It's completed.
01:00:43 - Laura: Okay.
01:00:43 - Laura: Not, yeah.
01:00:45 - Michael Kianmahd: All right, so I guess like Ai based application intake, the fact
that it's like almost five months and we've been working on it for a long time.
01:00:57 - Michael Kianmahd: Is that something we can just get to completion?
01:01:02 - Adrian Boerstra: I just bring it into July.
01:01:09 - Laura: Okay, so here's where the sliding will help, like we'll show you.
01:01:13 - Laura: So this is what we have right now as like our monthly limit.
01:01:16 - Laura: And then if I, so if I try and like pull that in, now you see the hours per month.
01:01:24 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah, don't worry about, Yeah, so what it's going to cost, what
it's so here's how I'm thinking about it.
01:01:31 - Michael Kianmahd: Okay.
01:01:31 - Michael Kianmahd: I want to be as aggressive as I could possibly be.
01:01:34 - Michael Kianmahd: And if that's not affordable, Dave and I are going to talk.
01:01:40 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah.
01:01:41 - Michael Kianmahd: And if that doesn't work, okay, then I, we're going to have to
figure some other way to get there and stretching it out might be the way to do that.
01:01:51 - Michael Kianmahd: Although I prefer not to do that.
01:01:54 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah, I love it.
01:01:56 - Laura: Yeah.
01:01:57 - Laura: Okay.
01:01:57 - Michael Kianmahd: So let's say- The way that I want to approach this for now is
I want to be a realistic that we can deliver what we're trying to deliver in a reasonable time
frame.
01:02:06 - Laura: Okay.
01:02:07 - Michael Kianmahd: Actually, I'm going to say this because Caleb, hey Caleb, by
the way.
01:02:12 - Michael Kianmahd: Here are the variables that we think matter.
01:02:17 - Michael Kianmahd: Impact, cost, value, accountability, priority, and risk.
01:02:23 - Michael Kianmahd: So those are the six things that we are thinking about
collectively to help us determine where to invest, how to prioritize, etc.
01:02:34 - Michael Kianmahd: Okay?
01:02:36 - Michael Kianmahd: So the Ai-based application intake, close to beta, if we deliver
it will free human beings up and then they can graduate and serve a different part of the
business.
01:02:48 - Michael Kianmahd: I'm not looking to terminate anybody.
01:02:50 - Michael Kianmahd: I'm looking to build resources and sort of like strengthen the
core of the business.
01:02:56 - Michael Kianmahd: And any technological improvement where the technology
makes a human being enhanced and more productive would be a win for the company,
would be a win for us delivering service to people, et cetera.
01:03:08 - Michael Kianmahd: But we have to deliver, basically.
01:03:13 - Michael Kianmahd: So if, for example, we decide this Ai-based application intake
cannot be delivered within 100 hours, even though we spent 50, and we can't retool it to fix
it and deliver that, I think we should just cancel it.
01:03:28 - Michael Kianmahd: So Adrian is saying, no, we can do it.
01:03:29 - Michael Kianmahd: We can do it by the end of July.
01:03:32 - Michael Kianmahd: I'm saying, wonderful.
01:03:33 - Michael Kianmahd: Let's just try to deliver somewhat seamlessly, put into pro-
duction, and it's working virtually perfectly.
01:03:42 - Michael Kianmahd: People are not making up for bad technology by spending a
lot more time cleaning up the bad data that it's picking up, and it's in the wrong fields, and
all that kind of stuff.
01:03:51 - Michael Kianmahd: And it'll add immediate, especially for the cost, operational
impact.
01:03:57 - Michael Kianmahd: It'll save us money in the long run.
01:04:00 - Michael Kianmahd: It won't have that much maintenance costs.
01:04:02 - Michael Kianmahd: So that makes sense.
01:04:04 - Michael Kianmahd: That's how I'm thinking about it.
01:04:05 - Michael Kianmahd: So let me pause.
01:04:05 - Michael Kianmahd: Does that make sense in how I'm thinking about it?
01:04:09 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah.
01:04:10 - Michael Kianmahd: Okay, so let's do that.
01:04:14 - Michael Kianmahd: Submit ownership and time.
01:04:17 - Michael Kianmahd: Anything ownership related, we should do it as soon as we
possibly can.
01:04:21 - Laura: That was a that should be a high then, right?
01:04:23 - Laura: The other ones are high.
01:04:24 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah.
01:04:24 - Michael Kianmahd: The reason why I made it a medium is like ownership and
tracking.
01:04:32 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah, you can keep it high.
01:04:33 - Michael Kianmahd: No problem.
01:04:33 - Michael Kianmahd: But I would just move it as closely as you can
01:04:39 - Michael Kianmahd: to when it's possible.
01:04:41 - Laura: I can't.
01:04:41 - Laura: I have to wait until the new data model and the merging Brtls, they're going
to start.
01:04:46 - Michael Kianmahd: You see what I'm saying.
01:04:47 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah.
01:04:47 - Michael Kianmahd: That's basically what I'm saying.
01:04:48 - Michael Kianmahd: If it's not possible until that's done, then let's focus on getting
the data model.
01:04:51 - Michael Kianmahd: That's a contingency.
01:04:53 - Laura: Yeah.
01:04:53 - Laura: Give me a sec here.
01:04:54 - Laura: I'm just going to pull these over.
01:04:59 - Michael Kianmahd: Every time you do that, it costs us more money.
01:05:01 - Laura: I agree.
01:05:04 - Michael Kianmahd: Short run, not total.
01:05:06 - Adrian Boerstra: Hey, you can't play the slidey game without spending a few
bucks.
01:05:11 - Laura: It's better than Vegas.
01:05:12 - Laura: With a dollar in.
01:05:15 - Adrian Boerstra: Okie dokie.
01:05:19 - Adrian Boerstra: That one's done.
01:05:20 - Adrian Boerstra: They all are like, what have we been missing out on here?
01:05:23 - Laura: You're right.
01:05:23 - Kaleb Dague: So much fun.
01:05:25 - Laura: Okay, those are all in September.
01:05:30 - Laura: So we're just looking at current month.
01:05:32 - Michael Kianmahd: Adrian, should I keep this in?
01:05:34 - Michael Kianmahd: Can I say one other thing?
01:05:36 - Michael Kianmahd: If these timelines are not realistic and there's a low probability
of delivering by that expiration date, please let me know.
01:05:44 - Adrian Boerstra: Well, yeah, and I think that's gonna be later in the work.
01:05:47 - Adrian Boerstra: Like, to your point, order of operations, are the projects right?
01:05:52 - Adrian Boerstra: You know, then where are we moving them into the right place
on the calendar?
01:05:56 - Adrian Boerstra: But then we can look at the resources and go, hey, see that line
above?
01:06:00 - Adrian Boerstra: If it's really lumpy, it's going to make it really hard for us to deliver.
01:06:04 - Adrian Boerstra: But if we keep that curve up there very predictable, then it means
that we're probably looking good to be able to get those projects done.
01:06:14 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah.
01:06:14 - Michael Kianmahd: Lord, data model, I would hope that you can get it done by
the end of July.
01:06:22 - Michael Kianmahd: That's like the highest, most impactful, freeze up everything.
01:06:26 - Laura: So that's what that, this actually should really start like here.
01:06:31 - Adrian Boerstra: This will show also the other leverage we have is, hey, temporarily
do we need to add some more resources on this to make more progress, right?
01:06:41 - Michael Kianmahd: We want Canada Day to align with Maxim Day.
01:06:48 - Laura: Love it.
01:06:51 - Laura: All right.
01:06:52 - Adrian Boerstra: It's kind of the golden age for Maxim and Canada.
01:06:55 - Laura: Yeah, yeah.
01:06:57 - Laura: Duplicate management, I'm gonna move forward.
01:07:01 - Laura: I'd like that earlier, but that should really kind of come at the end when we're
like with the data model.
01:07:08 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah, the issue is if you turn off, if you turn on automation.
01:07:13 - Michael Kianmahd: And the automation is building a bunch of accounts and that's
not set up, we're going to get screwed.
01:07:18 - Michael Kianmahd: So I'd probably not wait too long on that.
01:07:25 - Laura: I think you need it today.
01:07:26 - Michael Kianmahd: If you're, let's do it today.
01:07:29 - Laura: I'll introduce you to um, I knew at bloody.
01:07:33 - Laura: Um, okay, um, here's how we're looking.
01:07:39 - Michael Kianmahd: Let's get it all done and then we'll reflect back.
01:07:43 - Laura: Okay.
01:07:46 - Michael Kianmahd: Penske's fine.
01:07:48 - Michael Kianmahd: Uh, like, I'm, I'm cool with the timing of submit ownership and
time.
01:07:55 - Michael Kianmahd: I'm totally fine with that.
01:07:57 - Michael Kianmahd: Merging Bl and Tr, can we do that?
01:08:00 - Michael Kianmahd: Can we get that done sooner?
01:08:02 - Michael Kianmahd: Can completion date be sooner?
01:08:04 - Michael Kianmahd: Is that realistic?
01:08:07 - Laura: So data model and merging Br and Tr, again, they're quite linked.
01:08:11 - Michael Kianmahd: I think- Let me reframe this.
01:08:13 - Michael Kianmahd: If like, if the constraint was not money or time or human
capital on the Faye side
01:08:24 - Michael Kianmahd: And we basically had a unlimited budget to get all this done
as quickly as possible.
01:08:31 - Michael Kianmahd: Just tell me where the where that date is.
01:08:33 - Michael Kianmahd: Give me the outside date for that.
01:08:36 - Michael Kianmahd: That's kind of how I want to run this.
01:08:37 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah, that's where we just have to look at like what are the natural
project dependencies like we have to get probably scoring and hands been still done.
01:08:47 - Adrian Boerstra: Up front tech.
01:08:50 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah, that's where we might have to break out the merging Bl
and Tr out a little bit more.
01:08:55 - Laura: I don't know.
01:08:56 - Laura: This one and the data model, a lot of the starting points and I'll start
scheduling
01:09:04 - Laura: calls and having, I think I actually want to do like a standup, like a bi-weekly
15
01:09:09 - Laura: minute standup, but those ones rely so heavily on your people and their
calendars and their
01:09:17 - Laura: feedback and their input.
01:09:19 - Laura: So sometimes it doesn't matter how many hours or people I throw on it on
my end, I'm just naturally gonna like be at the mercy of waiting and getting that information.
01:09:31 - Laura: So I'll work with you on getting that and having like a cadence, even if it's
like three times a
01:09:37 - Laura: week or four times a week, and we just have like a stand up where I can
ask my questions and get
01:09:41 - Laura: the answers I need, which I think we'll probably need.
01:09:44 - Laura: A lot of that will come down to just like the fact that it's going to be like
people will take holidays in summer and then there'll be just like natural things that kind of...
01:09:54 - Laura: So I think...
01:09:54 - Michael Kianmahd: So t-shirt that too.
01:09:59 - Adrian Boerstra: Yep.
01:10:02 - Laura: You do want an actual t-shirt for the involvement?
01:10:06 - Michael Kianmahd: Just keep that in mind when we're setting timelines.
01:10:10 - Michael Kianmahd: If you've got a budget of an extra two weeks to account for
random delays throughout the process, let's do that.
01:10:16 - Michael Kianmahd: do that, but just know that I'm anxious to deliver on everything
we're trying to deliver on and I want to do it as quickly as possible.
01:10:24 - Laura: And yeah, so I think you're probably looking about the first or second week
for both the data model and merging Vr and Tl in terms of like everything, when you factor
in all of that, that's where I would think would be realistic.
01:10:38 - Michael Kianmahd: Great.
01:10:41 - Michael Kianmahd: Do you want to go through the rest of these?
01:10:42 - Michael Kianmahd: Or did we go through them already?
01:10:45 - Michael Kianmahd: Um, timeline-wise.
01:10:52 - Laura: I mean, the only thing I would kind of question is we do have some that are
high that are like potentially being done after lows.
01:11:00 - Laura: So, for example, you've put like the automated approval process at a low,
but it's actually on the calendar before the sales tax, which we've prioritized higher.
01:11:09 - Laura: So, I don't know if we want to just take a minute and like readjust some of
that so that we can get the right hours for you across the next sort of year?
01:11:18 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah, let's just start at the top really fast.
01:11:21 - Michael Kianmahd: We'll just go through it very quickly.
01:11:23 - Michael Kianmahd: So app intake, cool.
01:11:25 - Michael Kianmahd: End of July, Adrian, thumbs up or thumbs down?
01:11:32 - Laura: You're on mute, me too.
01:11:35 - Michael Kianmahd: Your avatar is telling you something.
01:11:38 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah, end of July will be good on that.
01:11:40 - Laura: Okay.
01:11:42 - Laura: And is that fair with all of like your holidays and stuff, the fact that you're
gone?
01:11:46 - Laura: Yeah.
01:11:47 - Laura: Yeah, okay.
01:11:49 - Laura: Yeah.
01:11:51 - Michael Kianmahd: Okay.
01:11:52 - Michael Kianmahd: Merging, yeah, the other two I have no comments on.
01:11:55 - Michael Kianmahd: I don't, those are not.
01:11:57 - Laura: Yeah, agreed.
01:11:58 - Michael Kianmahd: Honestly, I would call those, can you scroll back up?
01:12:01 - Laura: Yeah.
01:12:05 - Michael Kianmahd: I would call Penske low, if I'm like, yeah.
01:12:14 - Michael Kianmahd: And it's kind of on them.
01:12:15 - Michael Kianmahd: It's not a it's not like a contingency based on us there
01:12:18 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah, there's an element to that Penske one as well that some
of the work that I've already done around Ai
01:12:26 - Adrian Boerstra: application intake well
01:12:29 - Adrian Boerstra: Will technically help put the port us on what we want to give to
Penske like we will have
01:12:35 - Adrian Boerstra: We'll have an Api in a place to receive information because it's
already going to be receiving it from our Ai
01:12:41 - Adrian Boerstra: and that might, we've used kind of the Penske model that they
gave us, so that it can be very
01:12:50 - Adrian Boerstra: highly reusable.
01:12:51 - Adrian Boerstra: So a Penske thing might not also be as big as, how many hours
do you have in on that one, Laura?
01:12:57 - Laura: I think 60.
01:12:59 - Laura: That was around what we had guessed at.
01:13:01 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah, well we might want to tell Penske it was 60.
01:13:07 - Laura: I don't think we ever gave them an estimate.
01:13:09 - Adrian Boerstra: Did Penske ever tell you they Did they have some budget that
they were going to allocate to that, Michael?
01:13:15 - Michael Kianmahd: It's their call, not my call.
01:13:18 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah, I thought that they had actually said that they were willing
to budget something for that for you.
01:13:25 - Laura: They were, but they were starting the conversation, but they weren't ready
to actually start, I think, until they said August was when they had resources.
01:13:32 - Laura: But anyways, yeah.
01:13:35 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah, again, low priority for me.
01:13:38 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah.
01:13:38 - Michael Kianmahd: It's more of a benefit to them.
01:13:40 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah, yeah.
01:13:43 - Michael Kianmahd: All right, merging Blmtr.
01:13:46 - Michael Kianmahd: Is that timeline realistic?
01:13:48 - Laura: Yeah, so this and the data model I think like that sort of early to mid August
would be where is realistic.
01:13:54 - Michael Kianmahd: Can you hover over the time?
01:13:56 - Laura: Mm hmm.
01:13:59 - Laura: And just as a reminder, this currently encompasses like the Docusign,
Konga stuff as well.
01:14:05 - Michael Kianmahd: Okay, that's good.
01:14:06 - Michael Kianmahd: Let's go to the next one if you could hover.
01:14:09 - Michael Kianmahd: That sounds good.
01:14:12 - Michael Kianmahd: That makes sense.
01:14:16 - Michael Kianmahd: I imagine Laura ownership and tracking.
01:14:19 - Michael Kianmahd: I feel like there's some
01:14:26 - Michael Kianmahd: I can't imagine it's 30 hours for each segment.
01:14:32 - Michael Kianmahd: You know what I'm saying?
01:14:33 - Michael Kianmahd: I feel like it's high.
01:14:35 - Laura: Yeah, it might be it again.
01:14:37 - Laura: It's kind of like a T shirt.
01:14:39 - Laura: Yeah.
01:14:40 - Michael Kianmahd: So I don't really, I would say, look, let's, let's be a little bit more.
01:14:47 - Michael Kianmahd: Let's just cut them across the board and just make because
it can aggregate if how many of these do you have?
01:14:54 - Adrian Boerstra: Seven of them?
01:14:54 - Laura: No, there's one, two.
01:14:58 - Michael Kianmahd: How many total hours do you have for tracking?
01:15:01 - Laura: Five.
01:15:03 - Laura: I don't know how to find that without going over each one.
01:15:06 - Laura: That's what I'm saying.
01:15:08 - Laura: So, ownership.
01:15:10 - Laura: So, that's not right.
01:15:14 - Laura: Hang on.
01:15:16 - Michael Kianmahd: I guess, let's say there's a few.
01:15:20 - Michael Kianmahd: Let's say there's five.
01:15:21 - Michael Kianmahd: I can't imagine each one is more than 10 hours, 50 hours total
to do ownership.
01:15:26 - Laura: I don't think there are 10 hour.
01:15:29 - Laura: I think I'm going to stick with 30.
01:15:31 - Michael Kianmahd: Okay, fine.
01:15:33 - Laura: If it's less, yay.
01:15:36 - Michael Kianmahd: We're budgeting though, right?
01:15:38 - Michael Kianmahd: If it's over budgeting.
01:15:43 - Michael Kianmahd: I don't get it.
01:15:44 - Laura: One of those.
01:15:45 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah, that doesn't make intuitive sense to you.
01:15:47 - Michael Kianmahd: Maybe you can help me understand later, but fine.
01:15:49 - Michael Kianmahd: Okay.
01:15:50 - Michael Kianmahd: Okay, can you just go back to the top.
01:15:57 - Michael Kianmahd: So submit ownership, you have 30 in there.
01:15:59 - Laura: I have 38.
01:16:02 - Laura: I don't know why it's different.
01:16:03 - Laura: I can't remember if I'm.
01:16:06 - Laura: I can but I'll just put it at 30 to keep it simple.
01:16:08 - Michael Kianmahd: Okay.
01:16:10 - Michael Kianmahd: So that's 30.
01:16:11 - Michael Kianmahd: How much do you have for Penske?
01:16:13 - Michael Kianmahd: You said 60?
01:16:15 - Michael Kianmahd: Sixty, yeah.
01:16:16 - Michael Kianmahd: Okay.
01:16:16 - Michael Kianmahd: I'm not going to touch that.
01:16:18 - Michael Kianmahd: Merging Vl and Tr, you had 130?
01:16:22 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah.
01:16:22 - Michael Kianmahd: Okay.
01:16:22 - Michael Kianmahd: What's the next one?
01:16:24 - Laura: Scoring 20.
01:16:26 - Michael Kianmahd: Seems reasonable.
01:16:28 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah.
01:16:28 - Michael Kianmahd: Seems reasonable.
01:16:30 - Michael Kianmahd: Seems reasonable.
01:16:34 - Michael Kianmahd: Seems high.
01:16:35 - Laura: I honestly don't.
01:16:36 - Laura: I'm not confident in that one at all.
01:16:39 - Laura: Because I don't even really know that one I created like back when I first
started with you.
01:16:45 - Laura: And I think I estimated it back then.
01:16:47 - Laura: And I just basically taking it like I don't know.
01:16:50 - Michael Kianmahd: I'm not there's discovery that needs to be done.
01:16:54 - Michael Kianmahd: And then the solution and like, I don't think it's a 60 hour thing.
01:17:00 - Laura: Would it make sense to just change this to like a sales tax discovery and
then and put like, you know, yeah.
01:17:05 - Michael Kianmahd: And I would just move that up.
01:17:07 - Michael Kianmahd: That's a good idea.
01:17:08 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah, I would just move it up.
01:17:11 - Michael Kianmahd: And just let's budget five hours on it or something.
01:17:14 - Michael Kianmahd: You agree?
01:17:16 - Laura: Yeah, sure.
01:17:17 - Michael Kianmahd: Which is a lot of time.
01:17:19 - Laura: And then, so when did you want to do?
01:17:23 - Michael Kianmahd: No, I think we should do it in September.
01:17:28 - Michael Kianmahd: Because like all the docs and all that will be behind us.
01:17:33 - Michael Kianmahd: and then it's like, okay, what's the next thing?
01:17:34 - Michael Kianmahd: The next thing is like, okay, let's make sales tax more efficient.
01:17:38 - Laura: Okay, hang on my slider.
01:17:42 - Michael Kianmahd: Cool.
01:17:46 - Laura: Okay.
01:17:47 - Michael Kianmahd: Okay, then go, let's go to documentation
01:17:51 - Michael Kianmahd: Aio enhancements, what's that?
01:17:54 - Laura: So those are all of the enhancements that are going to get us basically to
the place where we can say goodbye to the funding checklist and be running with it where
the team is happy.
01:18:05 - Adrian Boerstra: It's gonna be incorporating all the feedback that we're still
gathering, right?
01:18:09 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah.
01:18:09 - Michael Kianmahd: When do we deploy to the whole market?
01:18:13 - Laura: So that's what I was talking about earlier.
01:18:15 - Laura: I'm gonna schedule the call with you and Juan and potentially Charles and
team early next week.
01:18:20 - Laura: And we'll make you aware of where Juan's at and we'll get his feedback and
we'll come up with that plan and all of the things that need to be done as must-haves before
we can get to that point.
01:18:31 - Michael Kianmahd: So that would influence this.
01:18:33 - Laura: Yes, as we spoke about, I just ballparked this one.
01:18:38 - Laura: Some of these hours, we don't even have tickets for yet because these
haven't come up.
01:18:42 - Laura: So I'm just guessing based off of my kind of knowledge in the industry of
how these things go as like over the next kind of quarter, we're probably gonna need to spend
about this much time getting Aio to a state where users are just happy.
01:18:59 - Laura: your dealers, your brokers are happy.
01:19:01 - Laura: Okay.
01:19:02 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah.
01:19:04 - Michael Kianmahd: If you think it needs to be stretched over three months, fine,
but that seems like a really long time for me.
01:19:09 - Laura: It's not like a project where I can say, let's throw more resources.
01:19:13 - Laura: It's literally just like over the next quarter, there are going to be things that
come up.
01:19:17 - Michael Kianmahd: That's what this is.
01:19:18 - Laura: So it's really like a calendar thing.
01:19:20 - Adrian Boerstra: One thing I'll point out, Sue, is the tool makes some basic
assumptions that we already know are incorrect, which is that the time is used in a linear
fashion.
01:19:30 - Adrian Boerstra: But when you stretch that out, it seems that all of, you know, it
just distributes it evenly across each week, the time, but that won't realistically be how it
happens.
01:19:41 - Michael Kianmahd: Okay.
01:19:44 - Michael Kianmahd: That
01:19:48 - Michael Kianmahd: seems fine.
01:19:50 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah.
01:19:51 - Michael Kianmahd: I mean, if we could push that up, like start September 1st, that
would be nice.
01:20:00 - Adrian Boerstra: Looks like if everything else goes as planned, start of September
is actually a little light.
01:20:09 - Michael Kianmahd: Okay, enoter at push up.
01:20:13 - Laura: Okay, maybe like start October kind of thing?
01:20:17 - Michael Kianmahd: Like August 1st?
01:20:21 - Laura: So I can't start that until all of the merge Brtl stuff is done.
01:20:27 - Laura: So I can put like September 1st or even like August, end of August.
01:20:32 - Michael Kianmahd: As long as it's realistic and we can actually deliver.
01:20:35 - Laura: Okay.
01:20:37 - Dave Kaplan: Adrian, how hard is it to add dependencies to this tool?
01:20:40 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah, yeah, that's one of the notes I made here, Dave.
01:20:44 - Michael Kianmahd: I think we'll, I think that'll be good to do that.
01:20:47 - Michael Kianmahd: What was Dave's question?
01:20:48 - Adrian Boerstra: Adding dependencies to the tool.
01:20:50 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah, we add dependencies and then we just have it automati-
cally draw a little line ones that are Notion does that really well.
01:20:59 - Dave Kaplan: I don't know if you guys use it, but we don't and we're tooled out I'm
actually rationalizing tools, but uh, but we can replicate the dependency linkage in this tool.
01:21:10 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah Okay
01:21:18 - Michael Kianmahd: Ux optimization I'd move up if we can.
01:21:21 - Michael Kianmahd: If it's possible.
01:21:23 - Laura: That one I probably wouldn't start that until after the data model, cause it
just wouldn't.
01:21:28 - Laura: I have to then redo it so, but I can start it like here.
01:21:31 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah, again, if we're not resource constrained, you can dual
track that with in order and you're not going to lose your mind.
01:21:36 - Michael Kianmahd: Let's do it.
01:21:37 - Laura: I can technically start that now and then stretch like just do little bits and
then stretch it over the next.
01:21:44 - Laura: If you want.
01:21:46 - Laura: But.
01:21:47 - Michael Kianmahd: That's up to you.
01:21:49 - Michael Kianmahd: Ok.
01:21:50 - Michael Kianmahd: I would deprioritize that from a timing perspective.
01:21:56 - Michael Kianmahd: This one?
01:21:56 - Michael Kianmahd: Everything else we've talked about.
01:21:58 - Laura: Ok, so I'm going to leave it in end of August.
01:22:01 - Michael Kianmahd: Ok.
01:22:05 - Michael Kianmahd: Those are fine.
01:22:06 - Michael Kianmahd: How much time?
01:22:08 - Michael Kianmahd: Sorry, I missed how much time we had allocated towards
that.
01:22:10 - Michael Kianmahd: Could you scroll back up, please?
01:22:12 - Laura: Ux?
01:22:13 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah.
01:22:14 - Michael Kianmahd: Ok, that's fine.
01:22:15 - Michael Kianmahd: What about ownership and time?
01:22:17 - Michael Kianmahd: 30.
01:22:18 - Michael Kianmahd: Okay, did we skip anything else above that timing wise?
01:22:20 - Michael Kianmahd: I forget.
01:22:21 - Laura: Uh, E-notary 32.
01:22:24 - Laura: Yeah.
01:22:27 - Michael Kianmahd: Can you scroll up a little bit?
01:22:29 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah.
01:22:32 - Laura: Yeah, 90 and then 24.
01:22:35 - Laura: Okay.
01:22:35 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah.
01:22:36 - Michael Kianmahd: Cool.
01:22:37 - Michael Kianmahd: Sorry.
01:22:37 - Laura: Thank you.
01:22:38 - Laura: Very good.
01:22:39 - Laura: Okay.
01:22:39 - Michael Kianmahd: Okay, um, the application process, that's insanely not worth
it.
01:22:46 - Laura: Okay.
01:22:47 - Laura: Do we want to get rid of it?
01:22:49 - Laura: Or just like earlier next year?
01:22:52 - Michael Kianmahd: No, I mean, that's definitely like low priority.
01:22:55 - Michael Kianmahd: So you can leave it where it is.
01:22:57 - Michael Kianmahd: I don't think it's going to cost 80 hours.
01:23:01 - Michael Kianmahd: So I would maybe make, call it 40 hours.
01:23:08 - Laura: We might want to recircle back on expectations.
01:23:11 - Laura: That one was scoped by me with Dana, one again when I first started, and
it was talking about the actual website and embedding Aio and then creating an Aio process.
01:23:22 - Laura: We might want to break that out into different.
01:23:25 - Michael Kianmahd: It doesn't have to be Aio, it could be Docusign.
01:23:28 - Laura: Yeah, I'm just saying it's not like create new application form.
01:23:32 - Laura: It was like multiple systems integrations, like revamping that whole.
01:23:37 - Laura: So we might want to revisit that and then break that out and give it a more
accurate estimate based on what's today.
01:23:43 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah.
01:23:44 - Michael Kianmahd: Okay.
01:23:45 - Michael Kianmahd: What else we got?
01:23:47 - Laura: So the Ux for sales.
01:23:50 - Laura: I would.
01:23:50 - Laura: That looks really high.
01:23:52 - Michael Kianmahd: Very high.
01:23:53 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah.
01:23:56 - Laura: I can't remember what I put on this.
01:23:58 - Laura: I'm going to put, I'm going to put 40.
01:24:01 - Michael Kianmahd: Seems really high compared to the other ones.
01:24:03 - Michael Kianmahd: I think others you had 24 hours.
01:24:05 - Laura: Yeah.
01:24:06 - Laura: This one will also encompass the lead conversion stuff.
01:24:11 - Laura: We talked about how they're screenshotting leads and not actually con-
verting.
01:24:15 - Laura: There is something around that and that will have a lot of technical stuff
behind it.
01:24:21 - Laura: That's what that is.
01:24:22 - Laura: It's not just moving things around, it's actually like the process and making
sure that it is streamlined.
01:24:30 - Adrian Boerstra: Got it.
01:24:31 - Adrian Boerstra: Okay.
01:24:31 - Adrian Boerstra: I mean, on any of these, Michael, if you want to time box it and
say, all right, you're saying it's 40 hours, but I don't see 40 hours of value.
01:24:41 - Adrian Boerstra: So do what you can in 24 hours.
01:24:44 - Adrian Boerstra: You can always time box something like that as well.
01:24:46 - Laura: Okay.
01:24:47 - Michael Kianmahd: I've got a call in five.
01:24:49 - Michael Kianmahd: I'm going to delay it.
01:24:50 - Michael Kianmahd: What time do you think I should delay it until?
01:24:54 - Laura: I feel like we're nearly there.
01:24:55 - Laura: We're almost at the bottom.
01:24:56 - Laura: Maybe another 15 minutes.
01:24:59 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah, I think.
01:25:00 - Adrian Boerstra: And then it's just a matter of like looking at, okay.
01:25:05 - Adrian Boerstra: How is our time distributed hours?
01:25:07 - Adrian Boerstra: What resources do we need?
01:25:10 - Dave Kaplan: So I do have a hard stop.
01:25:12 - Dave Kaplan: So Michael, a couple questions.
01:25:14 - Dave Kaplan: Do you feel like you have a good updated roadmap or you eminently
will based on this visualization is the first question.
01:25:24 - Michael Kianmahd: This is definitely a big step in the right direction.
01:25:27 - Michael Kianmahd: There's still some missing data and conversations that we
probably should have.
01:25:31 - Dave Kaplan: Okay, and is this visualization work for you, particularly if we add
dependencies and we use this to guide going forward?
01:25:39 - Michael Kianmahd: I believe so.
01:25:40 - Dave Kaplan: Okay, so then I'll let you guys continue then we will take.
01:25:45 - Dave Kaplan: The final quote, walked down roadmap.
01:25:48 - Dave Kaplan: And use that and then Laura, I and Adrian will get together and look
at the peak resource with no constraints.
01:25:58 - Dave Kaplan: Use that as a starting point for conversation on our recommenda-
tions and then Michael, you and I can talk about.
01:26:05 - Dave Kaplan: How that does or doesn't jive with your budget timeline expectations
and go from there.
01:26:10 - Michael Kianmahd: You got it.
01:26:11 - Dave Kaplan: Thank you.
01:26:12 - Dave Kaplan: Dave.
01:26:12 - Dave Kaplan: Okay.
01:26:13 - Michael Kianmahd: Thanks.
01:26:13 - Laura: Thanks, Dave.
01:26:16 - Laura: Okay, I'm sorry we were yeah, we're here.
01:26:22 - Michael Kianmahd: Yep, okay, let's go.
01:26:23 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah, I'm going to the next stuff.
01:26:26 - Adrian Boerstra: Just just as a heads up.
01:26:27 - Adrian Boerstra: I do have a hard stop at the top of the hour.
01:26:31 - Adrian Boerstra: I'm going to have to drop off for another meeting that's already
happening, but.
01:26:36 - Laura: Okay, I feel like we're close to, but I'll just I'll finish with Michael and then I
can.
01:26:43 - Michael Kianmahd: That's fine box.
01:26:44 - Michael Kianmahd: I'd move up Laura.
01:26:47 - Laura: Yeah, I can start that.
01:26:49 - Michael Kianmahd: The data model.
01:26:50 - Michael Kianmahd: I move up.
01:26:51 - Laura: Probably put it here.
01:26:54 - Laura: Yeah, I can start there.
01:26:55 - Michael Kianmahd: I would break that into discovery.
01:26:58 - Michael Kianmahd: Let's call that a discovery item.
01:27:01 - Michael Kianmahd: This one?
01:27:02 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah, it by it.
01:27:04 - Laura: Yeah.
01:27:06 - Michael Kianmahd: Shrink it to five hours.
01:27:08 - Laura: I
01:27:13 - Michael Kianmahd: don't have any experience with this, but there are some
thoughts on anything
01:27:22 - Michael Kianmahd: that would make collectors more productive.
01:27:27 - Michael Kianmahd: If they could cover two times as many accounts, and it's low
cost to implement that, they don't have to waste time dialing or copy-pasting numbers and
everything integrated between Leaseworks and Salesforce to deliver.
01:27:41 - Michael Kianmahd: That would be amazing.
01:27:43 - Michael Kianmahd: Actually, that's just one major thing is like discovery around
Leaseworks data integration to Salesforce is probably one major thing we missed.
01:27:52 - Adrian Boerstra: Laura, you should definitely think about bringing in Abby for some
of that user experience stuff, like in the things that Michael's, that's her specialty.
01:28:02 - Laura: Okay.
01:28:04 - Laura: Discovery, right?
01:28:08 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah, five hours.
01:28:10 - Laura: Okay.
01:28:12 - Laura: That's probably more like a, maybe like an eight.
01:28:17 - Michael Kianmahd: You got it.
01:28:18 - Michael Kianmahd: Your wish is my command.
01:28:23 - Laura: Are you taking other wishes?
01:28:25 - Adrian Boerstra: No, I'm going to drop off right now, but.
01:28:29 - Michael Kianmahd: Adrian, thank you.
01:28:31 - Adrian Boerstra: Thanks.
01:28:31 - Adrian Boerstra: You're very welcome.
01:28:32 - Adrian Boerstra: And I'm glad the tool's working out well for it, for this.
01:28:37 - Adrian Boerstra: So we should be able to make those other revisions too.
01:28:40 - Michael Kianmahd: Thank you.
01:28:41 - Adrian Boerstra: Cool.
01:28:42 - Michael Kianmahd: All right.
01:28:42 - Michael Kianmahd: When do you go on your trip?
01:28:44 - Adrian Boerstra: Tomorrow.
01:28:46 - Michael Kianmahd: Safe travels.
01:28:47 - Laura: Yeah, have a good trip.
01:28:48 - Adrian Boerstra: When are you back?
01:28:51 - Adrian Boerstra: 27th or 29th.
01:28:53 - Adrian Boerstra: Okay, awesome.
01:28:54 - Adrian Boerstra: On the Sunday, so I'll be back at work on the 30th.
01:28:57 - Michael Kianmahd: Enjoy.
01:28:58 - Adrian Boerstra: Thanks guys.
01:28:59 - Laura: Bye now.
01:29:00 - Laura: Okay, have a good one.
01:29:02 - Laura: Okay, when do you want the discovery?
01:29:06 - Laura: I probably wouldn't get to it till September sometime.
01:29:10 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah, sounds good.
01:29:11 - Laura: Okay, medium?
01:29:15 - Michael Kianmahd: I would call it high, because again, it's like, if I could double
the, so right now collectors are spending around two hours a day on the phone.
01:29:26 - Michael Kianmahd: If we can have them spend four and they collect twice as
much money, it's like a no-brainer thing.
01:29:30 - Laura: Okay.
01:29:33 - Michael Kianmahd: But I want to deliver on the front end, Enhance first.
01:29:41 - Michael Kianmahd: If you could dual track it, I wouldn't mind doing it sooner, but
I'll defer to you.
01:29:47 - Laura: I don't think I'll have enough capacity with the data model emerging Br and
Tl.
01:29:51 - Michael Kianmahd: You got it.
01:29:52 - Michael Kianmahd: Let's definitely prioritize that.
01:29:55 - Michael Kianmahd: You can go with your second wish.
01:29:58 - Laura: You're so kind.
01:30:01 - Laura: We've got broker application process, that's still just sitting there.
01:30:06 - Laura: We've just sorry we're back we're down here
01:31:10 - Laura: Adrian, where is he?
01:31:13 - Laura: Hang on, let me see if I can just edit it, change the value stream.
01:31:18 - Laura: Is
01:31:21 - Laura: the box automated doc storage?
01:31:23 - Laura: I couldn't really think because it fits across all the value streams.
01:31:26 - Laura: Is that okay in product and program?
01:31:30 - Michael Kianmahd: I don't know what product and program means.
01:31:33 - Laura: That's like innovation around your tech stack, basically.
01:31:38 - Laura: Yeah, sure.
01:31:39 - Michael Kianmahd: Keep it.
01:31:42 - Laura: So going back up here, this is what that looks like.
01:31:44 - Michael Kianmahd: Let's look at maintenance.
01:31:46 - Laura: Okay.
01:31:47 - Laura: And these are your big guys.
01:31:50 - Michael Kianmahd: How much did you have in for dupe?
01:31:51 - Michael Kianmahd: I forgot.
01:31:53 - Laura: About 40.
01:31:54 - Michael Kianmahd: And then docs was 80.
01:31:57 - Michael Kianmahd: Docs, box, sorry, box, not docs.
01:32:00 - Laura: Oh, sorry.
01:32:01 - Michael Kianmahd: Box is 48.
01:32:02 - Michael Kianmahd: Okay.
01:32:03 - Michael Kianmahd: And then org cleanup is how much time?
01:32:07 - Michael Kianmahd: Holy crap.
01:32:10 - Laura: I don't think it's going to be that much.
01:32:11 - Michael Kianmahd: Okay.
01:32:12 - Michael Kianmahd: You want to just reduce it then?
01:32:14 - Michael Kianmahd: Sure.
01:32:17 - Laura: I'd probably put it at an 80.
01:32:19 - Michael Kianmahd: That's great.
01:32:20 - Michael Kianmahd: You just save 50 percent.
01:32:23 - Michael Kianmahd: It doesn't matter anymore.
01:32:28 - Laura: Data model refresh, 24.
01:32:33 - Laura: And then this is just like the regular like eight hours a week of like me doing
just
01:32:40 - Laura: Meeting with you and meeting with people and adding new users and stuff
01:32:44 - Michael Kianmahd: so you have
01:32:46 - Michael Kianmahd: And that's for a full year of work
01:32:48 - Laura: Yeah
01:32:49 - Laura: So that's kind of like you know how we have our axia right now and you've
got 30 hours a month and we blow through
01:32:54 - Laura: That and like the first week and a half every
01:32:56 - Laura: This is pretty much like an eight.
01:32:59 - Laura: This is like every week out of every month, I will dedicate eight hours to just
like managing your account, which is like meeting with you guys, like when someone Google
chats me, like if we need a new user, if there's a bug, if they're like, it's that.
01:33:16 - Laura: And then there'll be a little bit of time for like someone wants a little like
feature that I can deliver in like a couple hours that I'm like, this would create some wins.
01:33:23 - Laura: It's that, it's that time.
01:33:27 - Michael Kianmahd: Okay, I think 30 hours a month would be 360 hours and you
have a much higher number than that.
01:33:40 - Laura: So I have eight hours a week and then I just times my math here.
01:33:44 - Laura: I just times eight by 52 to give me 416 hours and then again it just like
calculates that per week.
01:33:51 - Laura: Is that a terrible math?
01:33:56 - Laura: I'll show you what I did.
01:33:57 - Laura: I took today or yesterday and then I went till next time, this time next year.
01:34:05 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah.
01:34:06 - Michael Kianmahd: If it's 30 hours a month, it should be like 360 hours max and
that assumes the entire 30 hours a month is spent for maintenance.
01:34:13 - Michael Kianmahd: Does that sound like a reasonable estimate?
01:34:16 - Michael Kianmahd: That seems really high to me is what I'm trying to say.
01:34:19 - Laura: Yeah.
01:34:19 - Laura: I just put eight hours a week and then I just went eight times 52.
01:34:22 - Laura: It was a ballpark, so I can adjust that.
01:34:26 - Michael Kianmahd: Can you make it four hours a week?
01:34:34 - Michael Kianmahd: It's a lot of time because it's not every week.
01:34:37 - Laura: No.
01:34:39 - Laura: I'm just trying to think.
01:34:41 - Laura: Every week, we have at a minimum usually two hours of meetings.
01:34:47 - Michael Kianmahd: Plus.
01:34:48 - Michael Kianmahd: Which will have less meetings and all this stuff is done, right?
01:34:52 - Laura: Hopefully, kind of.
01:34:57 - Laura: Yeah, I could probably do four hours a week.
01:35:01 - Michael Kianmahd: There you go.
01:35:03 - Laura: What do you want that number to be?
01:35:06 - Laura: Four times 52?
01:35:07 - Laura: So 200?
01:35:08 - Michael Kianmahd: Just call it like 200 and...
01:35:10 - Michael Kianmahd: 200 and 52.
01:35:11 - Laura: Okay
01:35:18 - Laura: so that's where we're at.
01:35:20 - Michael Kianmahd: How much was data model refresh?
01:35:22 - Michael Kianmahd: I forgot.
01:35:24 - Laura: Uh, 124.
01:35:27 - Laura: That's a pretty accurate estimate.
01:35:29 - Laura: If anything, it's under.
01:35:32 - Michael Kianmahd: That's not allowed.
01:35:35 - Laura: And I actually have an epic with like stories and all of the things that are
going to need to be done.
01:35:40 - Michael Kianmahd: Okay, so now let's look at the next six months, four months,
five months, whatever it is.
01:35:48 - Laura: So next quarter?
01:35:51 - Laura: Is that what you mean?
01:35:51 - Laura: Like you want to see?
01:35:53 - Michael Kianmahd: I just, yeah, so if you, I mean
01:35:59 - Michael Kianmahd: I guess through the next year, right?
01:36:02 - Laura: Well, I don't have anything for next year.
01:36:04 - Michael Kianmahd: The next 12 months.
01:36:09 - Laura: Oh, like current year you want to see?
01:36:12 - Michael Kianmahd: I guess you could do current year, sure.
01:36:15 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah, okay.
01:36:15 - Michael Kianmahd: So we, it requires
01:36:19 - Michael Kianmahd: so where, where is like the peak month with the peak number
of hours?
01:36:24 - Laura: Probably July and July and September.
01:36:28 - Michael Kianmahd: So basically what I'm not sure about is if any single month
requires 400 hours of your time, it's not possible.
01:36:40 - Laura: Well, yeah.
01:36:41 - Laura: But that's, so do you see these up here?
01:36:43 - Laura: Yeah, yeah.
01:36:44 - Laura: That's resourcing peaks.
01:36:46 - Laura: So this tells you based off the tickets, because remember Adrian said that
it doesn't know which months.
01:36:52 - Laura: So if you have this and it's spread over two months, it doesn't know that
it's gonna be 40 hours in June and then 50 hours, like it doesn't know that, it's just equally
spreading them.
01:37:01 - Laura: But it's also calculating like how much resource
01:37:05 - Laura: so this year that's your peak
01:37:06 - Laura: we're gonna probably need the most hours
01:37:08 - Laura: like coming up in July, end of June and July
01:37:12 - Laura: if we wanna get the data model refresh
01:37:15 - Laura: and the merging Br and Tl
01:37:17 - Laura: and all of these things done, right?
01:37:19 - Laura: Cause this one's gonna take, yeah, so.
01:37:21 - Michael Kianmahd: So what, so I guess what I need is like an accounting of like
how much time is needed for the rest of June, July, August, and September.
01:37:32 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah.
01:37:33 - Michael Kianmahd: And then let's deliver.
01:37:37 - Michael Kianmahd: And then if there's like an economic model that me, Dave,
Caleb, and David Faye need to like figure out to make sure that, you know.
01:37:44 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah.
01:37:45 - Michael Kianmahd: We can do, I think we're all incentivized to do it sooner rather
than later.
01:37:49 - Laura: Yeah.
01:37:50 - Michael Kianmahd: And you know, part of it's budgetary constraint, Part of it's like
what threshold they need for it to be worth it for them.
01:38:00 - Michael Kianmahd: So all those things I just wanna figure out and we just need
like an allocation of time that's expected and then take it from there.
01:38:09 - Laura: Okay, so if you're happy with all of this
01:38:11 - Laura: and where it's all sitting
01:38:12 - Laura: what I'll do is I'll have Adrian help
01:38:14 - Laura: with getting that and all those details
01:38:17 - Laura: and then him and Dave and me and Caleb can work out for you
01:38:21 - Laura: and say, hey, we need like X amount of hours for June
01:38:25 - Laura: X for July, X for August.
01:38:26 - Laura: And then you guys can work on whether you just like, you know, span that
like the same amount of hours over and we just like move things slightly or whether you
have like buckets of hours each month.
01:38:36 - Laura: I'll let you guys like work on that.
01:38:38 - Laura: But if you're happy with all of this and where they sit.
01:38:41 - Michael Kianmahd: As long as we can deliver, right?
01:38:43 - Michael Kianmahd: It's all for naught if we can't actually deliver these things.
01:38:47 - Laura: A hundred percent.
01:38:48 - Laura: I'll take that offline too without everybody watching me do it.
01:38:52 - Laura: And I'll make sure that I think those are realistic.
01:38:56 - Laura: And if not, I'll let you know that these have slid for by a couple of weeks
each side, and then you can have a look at where that sits.
01:39:03 - Laura: Does that make sense?
01:39:04 - Michael Kianmahd: Yes.
01:39:05 - Laura: Okay, perfect.
01:39:06 - Michael Kianmahd: You know what also would be helpful is, I don't know if this is
possible or if we're just gonna be on call, but I think you know our people now and you kind
of know what you need from each of us.
01:39:18 - Laura: Yeah.
01:39:19 - Michael Kianmahd: So if we could be mindful of how much time it needs from us
01:39:29 - Michael Kianmahd: and how participatory it's going to be
01:39:31 - Michael Kianmahd: and how we can time block that around business hours that
01:39:35 - Michael Kianmahd: don't impact our ability to provide good service to people
01:39:38 - Michael Kianmahd: that's another sort of angle and constraint
01:39:41 - Michael Kianmahd: that we should consider that might slow down the project
01:39:43 - Michael Kianmahd: aside from budgetary constraints or resource constraints
01:39:46 - Michael Kianmahd: on the phase side.
01:39:47 - Laura: Yeah, so actually going back to that point, I would like, so for the data model
and merging Brntl, there are a lot of little questions that are going to come up daily.
01:40:00 - Laura: Like I already have a list where I'm just like, but I need that kind of that group
of users.
01:40:05 - Laura: So I would like, do you know what like daily standups are?
01:40:09 - Laura: No.
01:40:10 - Laura: Okay, so when you work a tech, like when you work projects, basically have
the concept of like a standup where it's just a quick 15 minute call.
01:40:19 - Laura: And you basically like you go through what was accomplished, what are
you doing today?
01:40:24 - Laura: And then what are your blockers?
01:40:26 - Laura: I.e.
01:40:27 - Laura: what are my questions?
01:40:28 - Laura: And it's just like, there's no like big discussions, right?
01:40:31 - Laura: You can like schedule sidebars.
01:40:33 - Laura: And it's just my way of like telling you guys where I'm at, what I'm working
on, and then getting the answers to my questions.
01:40:40 - Laura: I think that would probably be a really good and quick way to get what I
need in order to keep it moving with like all of the resources that I need.
01:40:49 - Laura: So we don't have to do it every day, but I think probably like twice a week,
at least to start, probably starting next week would be good.
01:40:58 - Michael Kianmahd: The Searing Committee is one of the events.
01:41:03 - Michael Kianmahd: The second one is the Thursday recurring call.
01:41:10 - Michael Kianmahd: We already have the time scheduled.
01:41:13 - Michael Kianmahd: If you need to pull people in, let's pull them in.
01:41:17 - Michael Kianmahd: You'll need to be proactive about that.
01:41:22 - Laura: Okay, I was kind of thinking that they would be their own living breathing
thing.
01:41:27 - Laura: I don't know if you need everybody on like, those calls, I would I would do
it separately.
01:41:35 - Michael Kianmahd: Okay.
01:41:36 - Laura: And honestly, for the next like, until maybe we get our rocks and stuff, the
steering committee could be replaced with like, hey, guys, here's an update.
01:41:44 - Laura: Because I feel like we've got our projects and it's almost like we're now in
just needing to shift into like
01:41:52 - Laura: project mode for sure yeah okay um is it the same people on the steering
committee call
01:41:58 - Laura: that would need to be available uh that would need to be there for that
01:42:04 - Michael Kianmahd: i feel like it is yeah okay i mean it's totally i mean you know
who can answer most of your
01:42:10 - Michael Kianmahd: questions.
01:42:11 - Michael Kianmahd: So, yeah, just like I don't want to have like a like a like I don't
have meetings
01:42:16 - Michael Kianmahd: about meetings like so you have everyone on the phone that
are mostly relevant and you want to do
01:42:23 - Michael Kianmahd: your stand up and do your thing and let's just if we can use
that time let's use it.
01:42:30 - Laura: Okay, I'm gonna repurpose steering then I'm just gonna like delete the series
and re-add and it's just gonna and be like data model merging Brtl kind of like information
session where I can use it to get the information I need.
01:42:43 - Laura: And I'll probably then have a quick 15 minute one either on Wednesdays or
Thursdays to give me that.
01:42:50 - Laura: And if I don't need it, I cancel it.
01:42:52 - Michael Kianmahd: Here's what I'm telling you.
01:42:54 - Michael Kianmahd: I think the time blocking 11 o'clock on Mondays, that time
works for the group that's on there.
01:43:00 - Laura: Yeah, I'll use that time.
01:43:02 - Michael Kianmahd: That's what I'm saying.
01:43:02 - Michael Kianmahd: So instead of canceling it, you could just proactively delete
people off you don't need.
01:43:08 - Laura: Okay.
01:43:09 - Michael Kianmahd: Or you could, we could have everyone join.
01:43:13 - Michael Kianmahd: You could do the macro update.
01:43:15 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah.
01:43:15 - Michael Kianmahd: And then ask people to stay on to address your specific
questions.
01:43:18 - Michael Kianmahd: And we can use that time to keep moving quickly.
01:43:22 - Laura: Okay, I'll, yeah, that's, that works for me.
01:43:24 - Michael Kianmahd: I'll do that.
01:43:25 - Michael Kianmahd: Then secondly, if you needed a second check-in day, we have
Thursday.
01:43:32 - Michael Kianmahd: Okay.
01:43:33 - Michael Kianmahd: On our calendars, you and me.
01:43:35 - Michael Kianmahd: So what I'm saying is, if you wanna proactively add people to
that, to get additional questions answered, and you want my involvement, that is a good time
for me to do it.
01:43:48 - Michael Kianmahd: And I think for the most part, people don't have conflicts.
01:43:51 - Michael Kianmahd: And then if you have other sort of mini discussions that you
need to have with people, like 15 minutes here, 30 minute here, you can just proactively reach
out to that individual, as long as you don't need me.
01:44:01 - Laura: Yeah, okay, that works for me.
01:44:02 - Laura: Yeah.
01:44:03 - Laura: Okay, cool, I'll do that.
01:44:05 - Michael Kianmahd: Okay.
01:44:07 - Michael Kianmahd: So just so I have a sense, is there a way from this report to
estimate like how much you have budgeted for June, July, August, or do you need to go
calculate that?
01:44:16 - Laura: Honestly, I don't know.
01:44:17 - Laura: I'm gonna ask Adrian.
01:44:19 - Laura: So first step, I'm gonna offline, I'm gonna review and just make sure that
me personally, like I'll be able to deliver regardless of other resources.
01:44:28 - Laura: a lot of this is me, is very like me intensive.
01:44:31 - Laura: So I'll just double check and make sure, then I'll work with Adrian to get that
view.
01:44:37 - Laura: I will be able to like, he'll be able to get it somehow.
01:44:40 - Laura: We also have to consider like, how much of my time will be available and
then how many resources we need and whether or not those people will be available to start
like Monday, right?
01:44:52 - Michael Kianmahd: Cause that's- Yeah, can we wrap this up tomorrow?
01:44:56 - Laura: Yeah, I'll poke them right now.
01:44:58 - Laura: I know they're both in calls, but yes, we can because we have to because
Adrian's going.
01:45:03 - Michael Kianmahd: Or do you want to talk later this afternoon?
01:45:08 - Laura: Let me circle back to you.
01:45:10 - Laura: Are you in meetings for the rest of the day?
01:45:13 - Laura: If I just chat you, will you see that?
01:45:15 - Michael Kianmahd: It would be better if we have a time scheduled, if I'm being
honest with you.
01:45:19 - Laura: I don't know if I'm going to have everything solved.
01:45:22 - Laura: of a meeting.
01:45:23 - Laura: So let me just come back to you and I'll put everything in your calendar
when you're free if it's relevant.
01:45:30 - Michael Kianmahd: You can see my availability right?
01:45:32 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah I can.
01:45:33 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah so just use that.
01:45:34 - Michael Kianmahd: Will do.
01:45:35 - Laura: Okay awesome.
01:45:36 - Laura: Okay anything else that you needed today?
01:45:40 - Michael Kianmahd: Some other ideas.
01:45:42 - Michael Kianmahd: So totally get and understand and appreciate that it's you.
01:45:47 - Michael Kianmahd: So from like a face staffing perspective if we could be your
single party client through this period and that frees you up so that you could be available
to help us deliver what we want to do in this time frame, that could be a cool lever to pull.
01:46:05 - Michael Kianmahd: The second is if there's somebody that you can bring on that
shares part of your brain and you could sort of delegate some of what you're trying to do to
that person and you trust their output.
01:46:19 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah.
01:46:20 - Michael Kianmahd: And it adds some scale.
01:46:21 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah.
01:46:23 - Michael Kianmahd: That's another option
01:46:24 - Michael Kianmahd: but I don't know how this stuff is managed
01:46:26 - Michael Kianmahd: I don't know how Fam manages it
01:46:27 - Michael Kianmahd: or how you wanna manage it
01:46:28 - Michael Kianmahd: but if a big part of this is driven
01:46:31 - Michael Kianmahd: by your resource availability
01:46:34 - Michael Kianmahd: then the first level we need to pull on
01:46:35 - Michael Kianmahd: is just freeing up your time for other stuff
01:46:37 - Michael Kianmahd: so you can knock this out for us.
01:46:39 - Laura: Yeah, so that's not gonna happen, because I have other clients who are like
you, who say the same thing.
01:46:46 - Michael Kianmahd: No.
01:46:47 - Michael Kianmahd: So, yeah, but- They're not as convincing as me, right?
01:46:53 - Laura: Yeah, they're not as persistent, I'll give you that.
01:46:57 - Laura: It will be like, we'll bring resources on who will help.
01:47:02 - Laura: And yeah, I just have to look at like the work as well.
01:47:04 - Laura: So for example, the Ai based thing, that's fully Adrian, that's not me pretty
much at all.
01:47:09 - Laura: So like, I'll look at now how we've prioritized all of this and I'll get everything
and say, hey guys, this is what I can deliver.
01:47:17 - Laura: Like this is what I can contribute.
01:47:18 - Laura: This is my gap.
01:47:20 - Laura: And then we'll figure out like who to, cause even if we were to throw me on
full time, it probably still wouldn't be enough.
01:47:28 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah.
01:47:30 - Laura: We'll work through that.
01:47:31 - Laura: Don't worry.
01:47:33 - Michael Kianmahd: I'm worried.
01:47:35 - Laura: Okay.
01:47:39 - Laura: Well, don't be worried.
01:47:41 - Laura: I'm not going anywhere.
01:47:42 - Laura: I can't have me full time, but I'm not going anywhere.
01:47:44 - Laura: I'll still be here.
01:47:45 - Laura: Most of this will be me.
01:47:46 - Laura: But yeah, we'll get it done.
01:47:50 - Laura: Sounds good.
01:47:51 - Michael Kianmahd: Ok.
01:47:51 - Michael Kianmahd: Ok, talk to you guys in a bit.
01:47:53 - Michael Kianmahd: Ok, thanks, Michael.
01:47:54 - Michael Kianmahd: All right, thanks.
01:47:55 - Michael Kianmahd: Bye.
