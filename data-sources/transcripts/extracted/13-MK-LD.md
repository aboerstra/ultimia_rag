00:35 - Michael Kianmahd: Did you ever watch that Npr thing I sent you?
00:40 - Laura: I don't know if I did.
00:42 - Laura: I probably had a million tabs, but sorry.
00:47 - Laura: Oh, wait, Npr.
00:49 - Laura: Are you talking about, I did watch your interview.
00:51 - Michael Kianmahd: I watched your interview.
00:53 - Laura: Yeah, I watched your interview.
00:54 - Laura: Yeah, it came, you know when like emails come just like at the right time when
you're like, oh yeah, if something comes at the wrong time, I'm like, it doesn't, it just gets lost.
01:03 - Laura: But I did watch it, I liked it, it was really good.
01:06 - Michael Kianmahd: Good, did that add any understanding about what we're up to
or?
01:11 - Laura: Yeah, yeah, I mean, it was helpful.
01:12 - Laura: There's not like, there weren't any huge surprises, but I just found it really
interesting.
01:18 - Laura: You really do love finance.
01:20 - Michael Kianmahd: I really love it.
01:22 - Michael Kianmahd: I'm a sicko.
01:23 - Laura: Yeah.
01:26 - Laura: Yeah, I think we graduated junior on the same time.
01:29 - Laura: 2010.
01:31 - Laura: Yeah, but I think I probably did uni differently than you.
01:35 - Laura: I did like an Oe in Amsterdam and I did the slow path.
01:41 - Michael Kianmahd: But yeah.
01:42 - Michael Kianmahd: Four years or five?
01:43 - Laura: So it was like four and a half.
01:47 - Laura: Because I did the Oe in Amsterdam that really didn't learn anything there.
01:52 - Laura: Yeah.
01:55 - Laura: But yeah, yeah.
01:56 - Michael Kianmahd: I think I sent you the other thing I sent you was a what's his
name?
02:04 - Michael Kianmahd: Post Malone tiny desk concert.
02:06 - Laura: Oh, I don't think you sent that to me.
02:08 - Laura: But you did mention it because I was like, I just want to see Post Malone and
Nashville.
02:13 - Michael Kianmahd: Just Google that and you can.
02:15 - Michael Kianmahd: Whenever you're bored.
02:17 - Laura: I love him.
02:17 - Laura: He's just got the best voice.
02:19 - Laura: And then tonight there's like some country.
02:21 - Laura: Are you like a country fan?
02:23 - Michael Kianmahd: My wife is.
02:24 - Michael Kianmahd: She loves country.
02:25 - Laura: Yeah.
02:26 - Laura: The only bad thing is that Nate Smith was supposed to come but he like got
sick or something so he couldn't.
02:31 - Laura: So now there's like a local band.
02:33 - Laura: But he the local band is like one of my best friends growing up.
02:38 - Laura: So I was like, Oh, that'll be fun.
02:39 - Michael Kianmahd: But yeah, that's cool.
02:41 - Laura: Yeah.
02:42 - Laura: So yeah, it's just like, anyways, I don't actually, I don't really have much for you
today.
02:48 - Laura: I have, I'll just give you like a time update.
02:51 - Laura: I'm guessing you want, or I don't know if you've had time, but like, if you want
to talk about like next, because we're near out of hours, we're at 80, just under 80s.
03:01 - Laura: We are about 86.
03:02 - Michael Kianmahd: I think, yeah.
03:04 - Michael Kianmahd: So like, I, there's like a lot for me to digest.
03:07 - Michael Kianmahd: If I was time constrained two weeks ago, it's way more acutely
ridiculous because you took a holiday.
03:14 - Laura: How dare you?
03:15 - Michael Kianmahd: no, I actually worked every day, but I just did the things that were
like that I needed to like not step up but I've started Ceo interviews I had one each one of
those are like hours and hours and hours and I just don't have time.
03:29 - Michael Kianmahd: I know yeah, I Just so I understand constraints.
03:33 - Michael Kianmahd: So like you guys like you keep working working.
03:37 - Michael Kianmahd: Yes, we'll get built.
03:40 - Laura: If you want.
03:41 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah.
03:41 - Michael Kianmahd: But I don't think like, when I recall what it looked like, I'm trying
to get things done as quickly as we possibly can, but it's like getting a bunch of people and
functions and all that to kind of line up.
04:01 - Laura: It
04:03 - Michael Kianmahd: is virtually impossible for me to prioritize because everything is
urgent.
04:07 - Michael Kianmahd: Everything's important.
04:08 - Michael Kianmahd: Everything's impactful.
04:09 - Michael Kianmahd: It's on my desk.
04:10 - Michael Kianmahd: I know.
04:11 - Michael Kianmahd: There's a bunch of bullshit too but and I have to do that.
04:14 - Michael Kianmahd: But yeah, I'm just trying to I'm trying to like trying to be thoughtful
about what I spend time on.
04:24 - Michael Kianmahd: And obviously this is probably one of the most impactful things,
but I want to get it right and I want it to be successful.
04:31 - Michael Kianmahd: And not anyone's fault, but it's not moving.
04:36 - Michael Kianmahd: Like as quick as I'd like it to be.
04:38 - Michael Kianmahd: And it costs a lot more than I expected to cause.
04:42 - Michael Kianmahd: And it's, I've got a lot of blind spots around technology and all
that kind of stuff.
04:47 - Michael Kianmahd: And a lot of what I'm listening for Coo interviews is for them to
kind of take this on and own it.
04:54 - Michael Kianmahd: So it's not on my desk.
04:57 - Michael Kianmahd: It's going to be a ramp up for them.
04:59 - Michael Kianmahd: It's going to take a long, if it took you a year to get your hands on
it, it's probably going to take everybody else 10 years.
05:07 - Michael Kianmahd: So.
05:09 - Laura: Yeah, yeah, so usually my rule, like six months, is usually when you're kind of
like, okay, I'm like, I can go for it.
05:17 - Laura: Yeah, and it's about where I was at and like, yeah, so yeah, you're right.
05:22 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah, what I would expect is like basically like between you, Ken,
and the team internally is like, I would expect this person to be thoughtful enough and be
like, okay, get me involved in every meeting.
05:38 - Michael Kianmahd: Slow down every meeting for me.
05:40 - Michael Kianmahd: Let me ask a ton of questions so I can learn as fast as possible.
05:43 - Michael Kianmahd: Everybody be patient with this person because the faster this
person picks it up, the more impact the person is going to make and the shorter amount of
time.
05:49 - Michael Kianmahd: At that pay scale, it's worth everybody's time basically to do that.
05:55 - Michael Kianmahd: One of the other things swirling in my mind right
05:58 - Michael Kianmahd: now about what we need to do or prepare for
06:01 - Michael Kianmahd: but I just want to make sure out of the gate
06:03 - Michael Kianmahd: who shows up is the guy or girl or person or whatever
06:07 - Michael Kianmahd: the politically correct way of things to say.
06:10 - Michael Kianmahd: So
06:15 - Michael Kianmahd: yeah, that's there.
06:17 - Michael Kianmahd: In the meantime, because this process could take...
06:20 - Michael Kianmahd: A while.
06:23 - Michael Kianmahd: Could take a month, it could take two, it could take six.
06:26 - Michael Kianmahd: If we don't find the right person, we're not convinced.
06:30 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah.
06:30 - Michael Kianmahd: I did my first one yesterday, I have one tomorrow.
06:35 - Michael Kianmahd: The guy yesterday
06:38 - Michael Kianmahd: very impressive person.
06:40 - Michael Kianmahd: The guy Friday, if not equally as impressive, more impressive on
paper.
06:49 - Michael Kianmahd: And then there's a guy flying week after next on Monday.
06:56 - Michael Kianmahd: And I budgeted basically two days with him, me for one, every-
body else the second.
07:05 - Michael Kianmahd: He's flying from the Midwest.
07:07 - Michael Kianmahd: But he basically built, he was chief digital officer at the end of
a$7 billion platform that did equipment plans.
07:14 - Michael Kianmahd: So like he knows the industry, he knows the market, he knows
what to do.
07:19 - Michael Kianmahd: I just worry he's a little too ivory tower.
07:22 - Michael Kianmahd: So that's what I'll be listing.
07:23 - Michael Kianmahd: You know what that means?
07:24 - Michael Kianmahd: Like corporate, like you used to- Too hands off, too much of a
delegator.
07:30 - Laura: Yeah, Adrian made a really good point though.
07:33 - Laura: Cause when I, when I spoke to him about that Coo role, I was like, you know, I
want, I want someone who can like be like technical and speak my language.
07:41 - Laura: Right.
07:41 - Laura: And Adrian was like, yes, but you also don't want, you don't want somebody
who's too like technical.
07:51 - Laura: In that nature, you actually want somebody who is good at delegating.
07:57 - Laura: Like you actually do, you want somebody who literally rallies the teams and
gets them to op like to work because that's really like operations.
08:04 - Laura: It's like you're not the person you don't want to you don't want someone who's
going to like do or get too much in the weeds of everything.
08:11 - Laura: Especially technical you want somebody who's just going to say like yeah go
do it but you
08:17 - Laura: know like I trust you we've agreed upon this like go do it right you don't want
somebody who is
08:23 - Laura: too um too in the weeds so a delegation I understand what you mean you don't
also don't
08:29 - Laura: I don't want somebody who just doesn't do anything.
08:31 - Laura: Cause I've seen those before where they just like are so ivory tower as you put
it.
08:37 - Laura: So yeah, you kind of need to find someone like in the middle.
08:42 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah.
08:43 - Laura: Okay.
08:43 - Laura: So what would you like me to do?
08:47 - Laura: So I'm progressing anyways, as you can see at the time, we don't, there's like,
we don't need to do anything today.
08:57 - Laura: The way that it works is you have 90 hours in the quarter.
09:00 - Laura: We've pretty much used those.
09:02 - Laura: So unless this has changed, and I'll double check with Caleb, but usually it's
like up to 50% of that you can go over.
09:11 - Laura: So you can go over the 90, like 45 hours, and they'll just bill you at the same
rate that taxi is on.
09:17 - Laura: So 185, I think it is.
09:19 - Laura: After that, I think they bill it our standard.
09:22 - Laura: That's usually, and that's why Caleb's usually like, get a Tnm for like 100 hours,
because then he can secure that at 150 or 185.
09:30 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah, I think that's, yeah, just be aware.
09:33 - Michael Kianmahd: So there's a few things that I need to kind of think through.
09:35 - Michael Kianmahd: So your plan had bringing in additional resources.
09:40 - Michael Kianmahd: There's that, yeah.
09:41 - Michael Kianmahd: That was one.
09:43 - Michael Kianmahd: Some of those resources were less expensive.
09:46 - Michael Kianmahd: So when were you gonna start that, like this week?
09:52 - Laura: Yeah, I mean, I already kind of them, but I'm limited because we only have so
many resources that are like available and are the right type.
10:00 - Laura: Like there's like, when you, it's almost like a mini me and there's, I can't, like, I
can't, those are hard to get.
10:09 - Laura: So we actually need to like, once we like, once we know we're gonna sign and
stuff, we would need to say, okay, like, who can we have and when?
10:16 - Laura: Like, that'll probably take a week to actually like, secure that person in for like
the time that we're gonna need.
10:22 - Laura: And that's fine, but it's helpful to know if you're, what you're thinking, so that
I can try and like, make sure I'm communicating to management about like, who I need and
when.
10:34 - Laura: So that's the only thing is that you just kind of risk like, with the 100 hour, if
let's just say you purchase the 100 Tnm, it'll mostly just be like me with engineering and then
occasionally like other work.
10:46 - Laura: So we're not like securing in another resource.
10:49 - Michael Kianmahd: If I take a week or so to get organized, talk to Dave, maybe have
a couple of questions for you, nothing gets delayed as a result of that, right?
11:18 - Laura: that would be the special resource who's gonna come in and we'll be able to
like, they'll know like Docusign and Konga and stuff.
11:24 - Laura: So that'll just get like a little bit backed up, but honestly, you're fine.
11:29 - Laura: We'll go over the hours, you'll just get billed for that at the standard rate.
11:32 - Laura: There's no like urgent rush and we're not close to month end either.
11:36 - Laura: They get a little funny at month end cause they're like, oh, we'll bill, right?
11:40 - Michael Kianmahd: So you're fine.
11:41 - Michael Kianmahd: I'll try to prioritize it and then set up whatever follow up conver-
sations I need accordingly and then we'll just get that wrapped up.
11:49 - Laura: Yeah, sounds good.
11:50 - Laura: That's all, I don't have anything else for you today.
11:53 - Laura: I will, sorry, I had no internet all morning.
11:56 - Laura: I was, but I'll look at that Konga thing today that you called out whenever that
was a couple of days ago.
12:03 - Laura: I haven't done that yet.
12:04 - Laura: So I'll do that.
12:06 - Laura: Otherwise, do you have any, do you have anything that you need?
12:10 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah, one quick question.
12:12 - Michael Kianmahd: Was there like a Plotty login I should know about?
12:15 - Laura: No.
12:16 - Laura: Okay.
12:17 - Laura: It's like, it's just an app that gets plugged in and then permissions.
12:21 - Laura: I have like, you probably have permissions because you're a system admin,
but like, doesn't it, there's no like external lock, my conga or anything like that.
12:28 - Michael Kianmahd: So like a billing console or like.
12:31 - Laura: No.
12:32 - Laura: So, I mean, like in Salesforce, if you go into your account there, you can
probably see the billing there.
12:41 - Laura: but otherwise it's literally like it auto renews every year too.
12:45 - Laura: You, whoever you put as like the person to like do the statement of work, will
get the like invoice every year, but it's pretty low maintenance.
12:57 - Michael Kianmahd: Okay.
12:57 - Laura: Yeah.
12:59 - Michael Kianmahd: I'm trying to think if there's anything else.
13:00 - Michael Kianmahd: I think we're good.
13:03 - Michael Kianmahd: Okay.
13:03 - Michael Kianmahd: Okay, thank you Laura.
13:05 - Laura: Cool, okay, thanks.
13:06 - Laura: Good luck.
13:08 - Michael Kianmahd: A lot of fun, it's really hard and it's rewarding, hopefully.
13:12 - Laura: Yes, yeah, get a good guy or gal, get a good person.
13:16 - Michael Kianmahd: Human.
13:17 - Laura: Person, human.
13:18 - Michael Kianmahd: Team member.
13:20 - Laura: Yeah, all right, talk to you soon.
13:22 - Laura: Bye.
