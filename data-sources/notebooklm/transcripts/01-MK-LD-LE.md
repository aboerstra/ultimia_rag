Faye x Maxim Weekly Transcript
00:03 - Michael Kianmahd: thing that occurs.
00:05 - Michael Kianmahd: There is no back and forth communication.
00:07 - Michael Kianmahd: that eliminates that from Salesforce.
00:09 - Michael Kianmahd: So Juan wants that cleared because he's had
00:12 - Michael Kianmahd: to manually reach out to Laura to delete that.
00:16 - Michael Kianmahd: It doesn't happen automatically.
00:19 - Michael Kianmahd: The third is custom checklist configuration.
00:24 - Michael Kianmahd: that would reduce the number of emails.
00:29 - Michael Kianmahd: that the user
00:34 - Michael Kianmahd: other in other words called referral partner would receive in the
event
00:39 - Michael Kianmahd: Our team uploads documents on their behalf.
00:42 - Michael Kianmahd: So right now.
00:43 - Lyndon: This is what came up in the preferred discussion when they said, yeah, we
get.
00:47 - Lyndon: a separate email every time any item is updated.
00:51 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah, which...
00:55 - Michael Kianmahd: you know, is like, honestly.
00:57 - Michael Kianmahd: Hey.
00:59 - Michael Kianmahd: a bit, you know, it's like a preference thing.
01:02 - Michael Kianmahd: So
01:07 - Michael Kianmahd: I think one specific comment today was, you know, when we see
an application and we already got bank statements and a CDL.
01:15 - Michael Kianmahd: And then we take the step to take that and upload that to AIO.
01:21 - Michael Kianmahd: They know they have already sent that to us.
01:24 - Michael Kianmahd: We're going through the step of uploading to the portal before
we send them the checklist to complete.
01:29 - Michael Kianmahd: with those items pre-populated in the checklist.
01:33 - Michael Kianmahd: Premier is saying is, we don't even know a checklist is coming.
01:35 - Michael Kianmahd: We're just getting these notifications.
01:38 - Michael Kianmahd: that you've uploaded stuff we've already sent you.
01:41 - Michael Kianmahd: So in my opinion,
01:44 - Michael Kianmahd: All these three things are tolerable.
01:47 - Michael Kianmahd: So like Laura, if you gave Juan the ability to delete.
01:52 - Michael Kianmahd: the superfluous old checklist that's showing up in that.
01:57 - Michael Kianmahd: Table.
02:00 - Michael Kianmahd: For bullet point two?
02:01 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
02:02 - Michael Kianmahd: That would solve that problem.
02:03 - Laura Dolphin: And Salesforce me.
02:04 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
02:05 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah.
02:06 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
02:07 - Laura Dolphin: It's on my list.
02:08 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
02:08 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah, so so like none of these in my opinion are like knee dabs
02:15 - Michael Kianmahd: I just, I wanted to get your take, like, A, do I understand everything
correctly?
02:18 - Michael Kianmahd: Hey.
02:21 - Michael Kianmahd: I guess let's start there.
02:23 - Michael Kianmahd: You feel like I got it?
02:25 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah.
02:26 - Michael Kianmahd: Good.
02:26 - Michael Kianmahd: I'm proud of myself.
02:29 - Michael Kianmahd: The second is.
02:30 - Michael Kianmahd: Do you agree that these are not must-haves?
02:32 - Michael Kianmahd: They're like preferred to have?
02:39 - Laura Dolphin: I mean, I don't think that's up to me.
02:40 - Laura Dolphin: I would, I can, I would honestly say that's a user thing.
02:45 - Laura Dolphin: Like you can work around.
02:46 - Laura Dolphin: All of these.
02:48 - Laura Dolphin: The fucking one specifically, we can work around and I can.
02:52 - Laura Dolphin: quite quickly fix that one in Salesforce if it's a priority.
02:57 - Laura Dolphin: One, and I just kind of handle it case by case because it's not a huge
volume.
03:00 - Laura Dolphin: but I can fix that one.
03:03 - Michael Kianmahd: How would you
03:03 - Laura Dolphin: fix
03:04 - Michael Kianmahd: that in Salesforce?
03:06 - Laura Dolphin: Well, so the issue is that like what they're what they're doing is they
basically they assign a checklist and then that checklist.
03:12 - Laura Dolphin: becomes like irrelevant for one reason or another and so what they
do is they archive the checklist
03:17 - Laura Dolphin: in AIO, but then it leaves kind of hanging fruit in Salesforce,
03:21 - Michael Kianmahd: right?
03:21 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah.
03:21 - Laura Dolphin: yeah but so the way that i can fix it is
03:26 - Laura Dolphin: two things.
03:26 - Laura Dolphin: Number one, I can give one or other users permission to just like
delete it in Salesforce.
03:30 - Laura Dolphin: It's manual.
03:32 - Laura Dolphin: Or I can just come up with a, and this would be my recommendation.
03:36 - Laura Dolphin: Both of them are quick.
03:38 - Laura Dolphin: come up with a little like action button.
03:40 - Laura Dolphin: So in Salesforce, instead of deleting it, they just click a button and it'll
just update the status.
03:44 - Laura Dolphin: of that workflow to like canceled and then it falls off their dashboard
and it signals that it wasn't like
03:51 - Laura Dolphin: wasn't there.
03:53 - Laura Dolphin: It's not relevant.
03:54 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
03:54 - Laura Dolphin: So that's probably what I would lean towards what the request here.
03:58 - Laura Dolphin: is just making that automated so that the user doesn't have to go into
Salesforce and manually cancel it.
04:04 - Laura Dolphin: That's what that second one is doing.
04:06 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah,
04:07 - Laura Dolphin: that's a nice to have in my opinion.
04:08 - Laura Dolphin: It can be handled manually
04:10 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
04:11 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah.
04:12 - Michael Kianmahd: Okay.
04:12 - Michael Kianmahd: So then the last one.
04:15 - Michael Kianmahd: It's a, it's the last one is the one that I was probably.
04:19 - Michael Kianmahd: See?
04:21 - Michael Kianmahd: most curious about because I don't know
04:25 - Michael Kianmahd: I think.
04:27 - Michael Kianmahd: The scope of this improvement is very limited.
04:31 - Michael Kianmahd: And I can think of like a bunch of different use cases or needs
that would.
04:36 - Michael Kianmahd: probably be better.
04:37 - Michael Kianmahd: So one thought I had was
04:40 - Michael Kianmahd: Before we send out a funding checklist to the referral partner or
to the customer,
04:48 - Michael Kianmahd: And we're uploading documents already received.
04:53 - Michael Kianmahd: Instead of having the ability to further customize checklists,
04:58 - Michael Kianmahd: What if we're prompted, do you want an email notification?
05:02 - Michael Kianmahd: Do you want an email confirmation to be sent?
05:04 - Laura Dolphin: Okay.
05:05 - Laura Dolphin: So this is exactly the one that I was working on this morning.
05:07 - Laura Dolphin: And I actually have an email.
05:09 - Laura Dolphin: from here that we went back and forth on today so um i don't know
if you guys remember but i kind of said
05:14 - Laura Dolphin: I'm going to be working on like the funding checklist because right
now one is still relying on those Salesforce funding checklist.
05:21 - Laura Dolphin: fields and the core the root of the issue is that the application
05:27 - Laura Dolphin: and all that data that gets sent is not coming through AIO.
05:30 - Laura Dolphin: It comes through email and it gets stored in Salesforce.
05:33 - Laura Dolphin: So we won't, we can't currently leverage any of like the AIO potential
functionality, which is in there like AIO validate.
05:42 - Laura Dolphin: product.
05:43 - Laura Dolphin: So what the issue is, is that
05:46 - Laura Dolphin: they have a bunch of application data that sits in Salesforce well
before we get to AIO.
05:51 - Laura Dolphin: So like a driver's license, whatever.
05:54 - Laura Dolphin: Okay.
05:54 - Laura Dolphin: And so what Juan's process is, is
05:56 - Laura Dolphin: Before they send the checklist, but in connection to that, they have
some of those documents already potentially provided.
06:04 - Laura Dolphin: that are in the checklist template.
06:06 - Laura Dolphin: And so what they do is they need a place to like go and say like,
06:10 - Laura Dolphin: Yes, we have that.
06:11 - Laura Dolphin: Yes, we have that.
06:12 - Laura Dolphin: So I kind of challenged and said, well, why aren't we sending out?
06:15 - Laura Dolphin: Like, why aren't we creating the AIO checklist first and then utilizing
that?
06:20 - Laura Dolphin: to say like we've got it we've got that we've got that and the issue
ultimately is that when you
06:26 - Laura Dolphin: send the checklist out, it gets emailed automatically to the partner,
right?
06:31 - Laura Dolphin: And then then they're getting like spammed with the emails and I was
like, well, hang on a second
06:35 - Laura Dolphin: What if we could just, in AIO, create the checklist?
06:40 - Laura Dolphin: do what we need to, and then send the email out, which to me makes
more sense because then you're not doing it in two places.
06:46 - Laura Dolphin: you're doing it in one place which is AIO you've got your master but
the partner doesn't get
06:52 - Laura Dolphin: emailed until we're ready to go.
06:54 - Laura Dolphin: Does that make sense?
06:55 - Michael Kianmahd: Can we do that today or do we need some sort of
06:58 - Michael Kianmahd: enhancement to be
06:59 - Laura Dolphin: made.
06:59 - Laura Dolphin: So that's what I asked Nir.
07:01 - Laura Dolphin: I just said, hey Nir, this is our use case.
07:04 - Laura Dolphin: How would you handle that?
07:05 - Laura Dolphin: And he said, in the portal,
07:06 - Laura Dolphin: So you technically can send a checklist and choose to send it to me.
07:12 - Laura Dolphin: So we might have to make a slight change in the way that we assign
that out in the API because right now what we're doing is we're going to assign that out in
the API.
07:17 - Laura Dolphin: What we do is in Salesforce, you put the checklist and we're assigning
it to the contacts.
07:22 - Laura Dolphin: So that's fine.
07:22 - Laura Dolphin: We can make that change.
07:23 - Laura Dolphin: I don't think it would be big.
07:25 - Laura Dolphin: And then in AIO.
07:27 - Laura Dolphin: So Juan could like do what he needs to.
07:31 - Laura Dolphin: And then what he would do is apparently there's like.
07:34 - Laura Dolphin: on the checklist there's a thing like the three dots and you could say
send to additional contacts
07:41 - Laura Dolphin: where you would then select your referral partner.
07:44 - Laura Dolphin: And he said he's going to check.
07:46 - Laura Dolphin: though with his team to see if it's available via via API.
07:51 - Laura Dolphin: So that we can make sure that like we can actually do what we want
to do.
07:54 - Laura Dolphin: But if that's the case, that's what I'd recommend.
07:57 - Laura Dolphin: And that's initially what I said to Juan as well.
07:59 - Laura Dolphin: It's like he needs that checklist where he can go in before they send
it out.
08:04 - Laura Dolphin: And then we just need to think through how we.
08:06 - Laura Dolphin: E.
08:07 - Laura Dolphin: efficiently take the contacts from Salesforce.
08:12 - Laura Dolphin: and then like push those to AIO at the right time and then so that we
can delay that email.
08:18 - Laura Dolphin: So it sounds like it can be done.
08:22 - Michael Kianmahd: So I had a couple of things that came out of this for me.
08:26 - Michael Kianmahd: So like.
08:30 - Michael Kianmahd: Right now, we are basically sending the checklist to one person,
right?
08:35 - Laura Dolphin: um i can't actually comment for probably like my guess would be 80
08:41 - Laura Dolphin: 5% of the time you are.
08:43 - Michael Kianmahd: Okay.
08:43 - Laura Dolphin: Then it might be like 15 you have to.
08:46 - Michael Kianmahd: Okay, so...
08:47 - Michael Kianmahd: go
08:49 - Michael Kianmahd: Technically, what we're doing by only sending it to the referral
partner or a couple
08:55 - Michael Kianmahd: contacts at the referral partner is we're basically putting the
burden.
09:00 - Michael Kianmahd: of receipt of document and upload on the referral partner we're
not we have no
09:04 - Michael Kianmahd: So it's not part of our workflow today to basically send requests
to customers directly.
09:11 - Laura Dolphin: Yes, correct.
09:12 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
09:12 - Laura Dolphin: So, I mean, if it's a direct deal, then you would send to the customer
for the
09:16 - Michael Kianmahd: most
09:17 - Laura Dolphin: part.
09:17 - Laura Dolphin: Probably like 90% would be the, that's your
09:20 - Michael Kianmahd: referral
09:20 - Laura Dolphin: part.
09:21 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
09:21 - Michael Kianmahd: So I was envisioning.
09:23 - Michael Kianmahd: a scenario where anybody working on the deal
09:28 - Michael Kianmahd: Customer, broker, dealer, Maxim.
09:32 - Michael Kianmahd: would see a checklist, could see all the things relevant to them
on that check.
09:37 - Michael Kianmahd: list and would only get notifications
09:41 - Michael Kianmahd: if those are within their scope of responsibilities for uploading
or approving.
09:47 - Michael Kianmahd: So imagine you're a customer, right?
09:53 - Michael Kianmahd: If you're a customer, there's no reason why you need to know
about dealer wire instructions.
09:59 - Michael Kianmahd: or broker wiring instructions or broker invoice.
10:02 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
10:03 - Michael Kianmahd: You're the customer, you're the actual truck driver that's going
to be buying the truck.
10:06 - Michael Kianmahd: All you need to know about.
10:08 - Michael Kianmahd: is that your driver's license has been uploaded,
10:11 - Laura Dolphin: your
10:11 - Michael Kianmahd: insurance has been uploaded.
10:13 - Michael Kianmahd: your bank statements have been uploaded and any other sort
of steps that
10:17 - Michael Kianmahd: the finance company is requesting for you to upload.
10:20 - Laura Dolphin: So
10:21 - Michael Kianmahd: when I was talking to Juan about this, he's like, well, if
10:23 - Michael Kianmahd: If I was going to do that now, I'd have to create like multiple
checklists and multiple views for each account.
10:29 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
10:33 - Laura Dolphin: That's how I understand it as well.
10:35 - Laura Dolphin: I don't what what your.
10:37 - Laura Dolphin: talking about is basically being able to assign certain steps.
10:43 - Laura Dolphin: In a checklist to different contacts.
10:46 - Michael Kianmahd: Or collaborators, right?
10:47 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah.
10:48 - Laura Dolphin: They're just called contacts, but yes, I know what you mean.
10:51 - Laura Dolphin: I just don't know if that's possible.
10:53 - Laura Dolphin: I would also have to check with MIR.
10:56 - Michael Kianmahd: Okay.
10:57 - Michael Kianmahd: So I guess like, go
10:59 - Lyndon: ahead.
11:00 - Lyndon: That seems like that would be a filter that would be within AIO.
11:05 - Lyndon: Hey, something...
11:08 - Lyndon: I'm not a fan of like the email spam thing either.
11:11 - Lyndon: So like when I heard preferreds feedback on that, I...
11:13 - Lyndon: That resonated.
11:16 - Lyndon: In prior life.
11:18 - Lyndon: We haven't had automated updates go out.
11:22 - Lyndon: it's there there is a button that the funder
11:27 - Lyndon: Press to say send funding update, funding status update.
11:31 - Laura Dolphin: Yep.
11:32 - Lyndon: And then wherever the status was, that was also how we...
11:36 - Lyndon: He tracked when an account had been worked because our procedure was
that every time
11:42 - Lyndon: an account was worked that the funder sent a status update.
11:46 - Lyndon: to the dealer.
11:51 - Lyndon: So like this whole notion of us sending updates every time we receive
something.
11:56 - Lyndon: Feels like that's, that's.
12:01 - Lyndon: spam certified and if we
12:05 - Lyndon: If our expectation is that funders are working
12:08 - Lyndon: every account at least once a day, which I think is
12:13 - Lyndon: definitely doable in today's world and probably even beyond.
12:17 - Lyndon: than if they're directed to send an update whenever they work the account.
12:23 - Lyndon: I've never had feedback from dealers that that type of approach.
12:28 - Lyndon: was not frequent enough communications.
12:34 - Michael Kianmahd: So.
12:37 - Michael Kianmahd: Couple layers.
12:41 - Michael Kianmahd: One layer to this, just reacting to what you're saying, is like...
12:44 - Michael Kianmahd: people's ability as a funder.
12:49 - Michael Kianmahd: to decide if an email gets sent if a funder does something.
12:53 - Michael Kianmahd: So imagine AIOs up, I'm uploading an ID.
12:57 - Michael Kianmahd: Do you want to update your referral partner?
12:59 - Michael Kianmahd: No, email won't get sent.
13:01 - Michael Kianmahd: That to me is a more elegant solution to address the core
problem.
13:06 - Lyndon: Let me say that again.
13:07 - Michael Kianmahd: So I'm a funder.
13:09 - Michael Kianmahd: I'm an AIO.
13:11 - Michael Kianmahd: I'm uploading the ID that I already got.
13:15 - Lyndon: Okay.
13:16 - Michael Kianmahd: Once I upload it, a prompt comes up and says.
13:19 - Michael Kianmahd: do you want to send an email notification to your referral partner
that you've uploaded this ID?
13:25 - Michael Kianmahd: Yes
13:25 - Lyndon: or no?
13:26 - Lyndon: That type of workflow is annoying as shit for users.
13:32 - Michael Kianmahd: As the funder.
13:33 - Lyndon: Yeah.
13:34 - Lyndon: Like, because every time they're up.
13:37 - Lyndon: dating something they're getting crap I gotta click through that now and
sometimes it's just a keystroke rather than a click
13:44 - Lyndon: But that's why if procedurally our expectation is, hey, every time you're
working an account.
13:49 - Lyndon: you're sending a funding status update.
13:53 - Michael Kianmahd: That was a different.
13:54 - Michael Kianmahd: problem because what was happening so we were doing that
13:59 - Michael Kianmahd: In production in Salesforce.
14:01 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah.
14:02 - Michael Kianmahd: We had a funding checklist that was in Salesforce and we had a
button and we clicked the button.
14:07 - Michael Kianmahd: And then you would get emails.
14:09 - Michael Kianmahd: crossover where like somebody didn't see that an email
14:14 - Michael Kianmahd: came in that had attachments and they just worked the account
and was part of their procedure to click
14:19 - Michael Kianmahd: submit funding tracklist update and then they
14:23 - Lyndon: didn't but that's a funding error then
14:26 - Lyndon: because part of their procedure should be, let me check and make sure I've.
14:30 - Lyndon: gathered all of the inputs that have come in.
14:34 - Lyndon: So I would go through the funding inbox and
14:38 - Lyndon: look for anything associated with this opportunity, make sure it's
14:43 - Lyndon: reflected within the system.
14:49 - Laura Dolphin: They
14:50 - Michael Kianmahd: did that.
14:51 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah, we did do that.
14:55 - Michael Kianmahd: I think the
14:56 - Michael Kianmahd: The best benefit of the portal is.
15:00 - Michael Kianmahd: not having to respond to status update requests.
15:05 - Michael Kianmahd: because the portal gives that to you in real time.
15:09 - Lyndon: True.
15:09 - Lyndon: Yeah.
15:11 - Michael Kianmahd: So,
15:11 - Lyndon: yeah, you're right.
15:12 - Lyndon: In theory, if the dealer or...
15:16 - Lyndon: broker is going to the portal
15:18 - Lyndon: they get their status update.
15:20 - Lyndon: The problem is they work with...
15:23 - Lyndon: what, seven to 20 different lenders.
15:27 - Lyndon: And so.
15:27 - Lyndon: So what is second nature for us?
15:30 - Lyndon: Hey, just go to the portal.
15:32 - Lyndon: shit, I got 20 portals I'm dealing with.
15:36 - Lyndon: Not as easy for them.
15:39 - Michael Kianmahd: Did we get that feedback?
15:42 - Lyndon: that there's too many
15:45 - Michael Kianmahd: No, that they don't feel like it's at their fingertip.
15:49 - Michael Kianmahd: It's like a chore to figure out.
15:50 - Michael Kianmahd: Where to get our information, which portal to click into.
15:55 - Lyndon: I did hear that in my discussion with...
15:59 - Lyndon: What's her name?
16:00 - Lyndon: Broker who used to work here.
16:02 - Lyndon: Katie.
16:03 - Lyndon: Katie.
16:05 - Lyndon: not specific to the portal.
16:07 - Lyndon: but specific to every lender has their own set of programs.
16:12 - Lyndon: Every lender has their own set of guidelines, their own funding procedures.
16:14 - Lyndon: their own way of receiving documents.
16:18 - Lyndon: So she didn't specifically call out.
16:20 - Lyndon: the portal but i i dumped that into the bucket that's where i got the 22 is i
asked her how many
16:25 - Lyndon: different lenders do you actually work with on a monthly basis?
16:29 - Lyndon: She said,
16:29 - Lyndon: 20.
16:30 - Lyndon: I'm guessing there's some who are 20 seems like a lot to me.
16:35 - Lyndon: So there's probably some who only work with like seven, but I would guess
there's.
16:39 - Lyndon: very few brokers who work with less than seven lenders.
16:44 - Michael Kianmahd: Okay, so I guess where I want to land at the end of this conver-
sation is what our asset AIO is and whether to tie the...
16:52 - Michael Kianmahd: renewal to delivery of these enhancements and to be pretty clear
about what enhancements we
16:57 - Michael Kianmahd: we'd need.
16:58 - Michael Kianmahd: So it sounds like
17:01 - Lyndon: I like the approach of...
17:06 - Lyndon: And look, if we can think it, it can happen, right?
17:10 - Lyndon: So I like the approach of having a filtered.
17:15 - Lyndon: checklist that can be sent to the customer.
17:20 - Lyndon: the vendor or broker at the same time so that they can see, all right, here's
the items.
17:28 - Lyndon: that are relevant to me.
17:30 - Lyndon: The one thing we have to step around in that
17:33 - Lyndon: case is that when the customers handle it all there
17:36 - Lyndon: items.
17:37 - Lyndon: They're like, why is my deal not getting funded?
17:40 - Lyndon: Well, there may be.
17:42 - Lyndon: Three or four things were pending.
17:44 - Lyndon: from the broker vendor that we aren't disclosing to the customer.
17:50 - Lyndon: So that could create phone calls, could create bad customer service expe-
rience.
17:55 - Lyndon: So, you know, maybe there's a separate template that you send them that
says, Hey, you know, other items are.
17:59 - Lyndon: pending, stay tuned type of thing.
18:04 - Lyndon: But I like that.
18:07 - Lyndon: And then outside of that, I would want to disable automated.
18:12 - Lyndon: push, all that automated push stuff, I kind of bucket into spam.
18:17 - Lyndon: And I would want it to be user delivered.
18:20 - Lyndon: Okay.
18:21 - Lyndon: User initiated.
18:23 - Michael Kianmahd: So do we want...
18:28 - Michael Kianmahd: So I think Juan wants this and needs this.
18:31 - Michael Kianmahd: I'm okay with that.
18:33 - Michael Kianmahd: What
18:34 - Lyndon: does he need that for?
18:37 - Michael Kianmahd: He just wants to know who touched the account last.
18:40 - Michael Kianmahd: So
18:40 - Lyndon: if
18:41 - Michael Kianmahd: like something is uploaded or approved.
18:45 - Michael Kianmahd: He wants to use last modified by.
18:49 - Michael Kianmahd: to help him infer who was last.
18:53 - Michael Kianmahd: dealing with that individual step.
18:55 - Lyndon: Do you hear yourself?
18:57 - Michael Kianmahd: Why?
18:58 - Lyndon: He wants to infer.
19:01 - Lyndon: That's not a great process.
19:06 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah, I agree.
19:06 - Lyndon: So I think if someone's working an account.
19:10 - Lyndon: there is a conclusion to their activity.
19:17 - Lyndon: Why not want to record a note?
19:19 - Lyndon: Okay, maybe I get that, but there should be something the user is doing.
19:26 - Lyndon: That is.
19:30 - Lyndon: whether it's updating the status or it's...
19:34 - Lyndon: Communicating a status update.
19:39 - Lyndon: I last modified by, especially, right?
19:44 - Lyndon: I'm thinking a couple steps down the path, Michael, to incentives.
19:47 - Lyndon: We established an incentive plan, part of that incentive plan.
19:49 - Lyndon: plan is, hey, you've got to work X number of deals a day.
19:53 - Lyndon: All of a sudden now this
19:55 - Lyndon: gets this is how we're tracking how many deals they're working well no
19:59 - Lyndon: No, that's not actually true.
20:01 - Lyndon: I did work that deal.
20:02 - Lyndon: Someone else touched it after me.
20:03 - Lyndon: I didn't get credit for it.
20:06 - Lyndon: Oh, crap.
20:08 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah.
20:09 - Michael Kianmahd: Okay.
20:09 - Michael Kianmahd: So I think what you're...
20:12 - Michael Kianmahd: correctly identifying is like, let's, let's align on.
20:19 - Michael Kianmahd: what our ass to AIO is.
20:20 - Michael Kianmahd: It might be a little bit different than what she thought it was.
20:28 - Michael Kianmahd: So in my conversation with Juan, I was like, do you anticipate
any other?
20:34 - Michael Kianmahd: enhancements or changes that you might need once we intro-
duce like
20:39 - Michael Kianmahd: non-titled funding checklists or real estate funding checklists.
20:44 - Michael Kianmahd: and he wasn't sure so i asked him to um
20:47 - Michael Kianmahd: checking with the team on that to kind of like see if you can think
around the corner that there's some sort of functionality that we might need.
20:56 - Michael Kianmahd: So what I'm hearing from you, Lynn, is we want...
21:00 - Michael Kianmahd: more definitive visibility over who actually did something.
21:06 - Michael Kianmahd: Not just modified.
21:08 - Lyndon: Yeah.
21:09 - Laura Dolphin: But...
21:12 - Laura Dolphin: What is it?
21:13 - Laura Dolphin: So when I...
21:15 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah, I challenged one on this too.
21:16 - Laura Dolphin: And I basically said like, why are you using, like, what are you actually
trying to get?
21:20 - Laura Dolphin: from that though so if somebody modifies it because it's obviously
like they shiver right like someone an email comes in
21:27 - Laura Dolphin: with a one of the steps and then that person will review it and then
they will put like a comment or they'll reject
21:33 - Laura Dolphin: it or they'll approve it or whatever and I know Juan wants to basically
see like
21:38 - Laura Dolphin: was it me or was it someone else?
21:39 - Laura Dolphin: Cause if it's, if he's looking at it and Zia Mara was the last one to modify
it, he might know that like.
21:46 - Laura Dolphin: he needs to do something.
21:47 - Laura Dolphin: But I guess my question is like, how does that actually
21:50 - Laura Dolphin: how does knowing that he didn't do it help?
21:54 - Laura Dolphin: Kind of like what Lynn was saying, like, does that actually?
21:58 - Laura Dolphin: do anything or should we be using?
22:01 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah, I think.
22:02 - Laura Dolphin: Or is there something else to like drive?
22:05 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah.
22:05 - Michael Kianmahd: So I think at scale, if you have.
22:07 - Michael Kianmahd: Multiple hands in the funding cookie jar.
22:12 - Michael Kianmahd: and you've got multiple people.
22:15 - Michael Kianmahd: playing musical chairs, playing on the same accounts and
uploading.
22:20 - Michael Kianmahd: steps for the same deal.
22:24 - Michael Kianmahd: because they're coming at different times and they're just like
processing it like a queue.
22:29 - Michael Kianmahd: one way to know who did what
22:32 - Michael Kianmahd: is kind of like in a filing system, like in box.
22:37 - Michael Kianmahd: If you upload something, you know who uploaded it.
22:41 - Michael Kianmahd: you don't have to like put your name in the file name there's like
a last modified by
22:46 - Michael Kianmahd: column so you know that like you know juan uploaded this step
22:53 - Michael Kianmahd: And you also see the date that it was uploaded.
22:55 - Michael Kianmahd: And then there's already approved reviewing rejected.
23:01 - Michael Kianmahd: So if.
23:01 - Michael Kianmahd: if
23:03 - Michael Kianmahd: If you upload something.
23:06 - Michael Kianmahd: and there's no status change what you would know
23:11 - Michael Kianmahd: is that the person that uploaded something is last modified by.
23:16 - Michael Kianmahd: And then what Lynn is saying is let's sharpen that in some way.
23:20 - Michael Kianmahd: I don't know how you do that.
23:21 - Michael Kianmahd: with AIO or what would be involved in that.
23:26 - Michael Kianmahd: But I think what we should do, Lynn, just from this conversation
is like, let's.
23:29 - Michael Kianmahd: So Juan is hopefully working on a task today to see what other
enhancements we might need.
23:37 - Michael Kianmahd: let's sync up with him let's have this conversation with juan let's
23:41 - Michael Kianmahd: Pull Laura in as needed.
23:44 - Michael Kianmahd: And then I'll go back to AIO with.
23:46 - Michael Kianmahd: the email that I already started drafting because what I wanted
to do is just gut check our requirements.
23:53 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah.
23:54 - Laura Dolphin: Put
23:54 - Michael Kianmahd: them on a timetable.
23:56 - Lyndon: Yeah.
23:57 - Laura Dolphin: So I just forwarded you both the email on the last modified by so that
you can see.
24:01 - Laura Dolphin: Go down to my original email.
24:03 - Laura Dolphin: Make sure that you're like getting the actual request that I got from
one and gave to near because they're putting that on one place.
24:09 - Laura Dolphin: I have a feeling from what I just heard from you.
24:11 - Laura Dolphin: That's not actually where you want.
24:13 - Laura Dolphin: to that so you might want to just review and then like step in there
especially if you're
24:19 - Laura Dolphin: Hinging your referral on the delivery of that.
24:21 - Laura Dolphin: If the delivery of that is wrong, then.
24:24 - Laura Dolphin: I would say maybe you need to think about that and then the second
thing is I heard a lot of like
24:30 - Laura Dolphin: kind of requirements come out of this call that is different from that
list that we just saw.
24:35 - Laura Dolphin: specifically being able to assign context steps and then or
24:40 - Laura Dolphin: and or separating checklists into like broker dealer.
24:45 - Laura Dolphin: customer and then I also heard like the email
24:50 - Laura Dolphin: aggregation or the way that they have emails going out for
24:54 - Laura Dolphin: specific interactions or actions with an AIO and changing that to
having like a daily summary.
25:02 - Laura Dolphin: specifically to certain people and then a list of their steps.
25:06 - Laura Dolphin: Those are pretty
25:07 - Laura Dolphin: fundamentally different from the way that we're doing it now.
25:09 - Laura Dolphin: So.
25:10 - Laura Dolphin: So do you want me, like before you go to AIO and say we want these
things?
25:16 - Laura Dolphin: Do you want to define your requirements a little further?
25:20 - Laura Dolphin: send them to me, I can write them up and then give them to AIO and
say, these are what we want.
25:26 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
25:27 - Laura Dolphin: Okay.
25:28 - Michael Kianmahd: Are you
25:28 - Laura Dolphin: guys happy to guide the conversation on your end?
25:31 - Laura Dolphin: of like the requirements and then just come to me and say, okay, these
are what we want to explore.
25:36 - Laura Dolphin: or do you want me to like guide you through that process?
25:41 - Michael Kianmahd: Lynn, I think we should huddle internally and then loop Laura in.
25:45 - Michael Kianmahd: What do you think?
25:46 - Lyndon: Yeah, Laura, are you seeing when you say, do you want us?
25:51 - Lyndon: Or do you want me to guide you?
25:53 - Lyndon: What?
25:55 - Lyndon: What gaps, what holes are you seeing or envisioning?
26:00 - Lyndon: that you think we may not.
26:04 - Lyndon: have covered.
26:06 - Lyndon: to be able to articulate the requirements?
26:11 - Laura Dolphin: I mean, as long as you...
26:13 - Laura Dolphin: understand, I guess, how it's currently built, like how the Salesforce.
26:17 - Laura Dolphin: AIO integration works, how each platform works in its own right.
26:23 - Laura Dolphin: And then if you're able to kind of see the gap between that and your
requirement, then I would say go for it.
26:30 - Laura Dolphin: I would, or if you just want to bring me like, just say like.
26:34 - Laura Dolphin: these are this is what we want and then I can do the gap that's fine
26:38 - Laura Dolphin: I
26:38 - Lyndon: think so.
26:39 - Lyndon: I think we'll go that path.
26:41 - Lyndon: Yeah.
26:42 - Lyndon: You're right.
26:43 - Lyndon: I don't think we have those.
26:44 - Lyndon: holes.
26:45 - Lyndon: I don't have those holes covered.
26:47 - Lyndon: I'm guessing
26:48 - Michael Kianmahd: from the
26:48 - Lyndon: email thread, Juan doesn't either.
26:50 - Michael Kianmahd: Do you want to address this on steering committee on Monday?
26:53 - Michael Kianmahd: Do you want to just workshop this on steering committee with
Laura present?
27:01 - Lyndon: No.
27:04 - Lyndon: I think we can huddle up.
27:08 - Lyndon: and probably tackle this and then come back together with an answer.
27:11 - Lyndon: And if there's...
27:13 - Lyndon: I think there's some time sensitivity on getting back to AIO.
27:17 - Lyndon: on all this kind of stuff.
27:19 - Lyndon: Like I think with the...
27:23 - Lyndon: questions swirling it would be good for you to be able to get back to them
and say
27:27 - Lyndon: Boom.
27:29 - Lyndon: Here's what we need.
27:31 - Lyndon: Here's my...
27:31 - Lyndon: proposal to you the longer that drags on i think the more a perception could
form of
27:37 - Lyndon: shit these guys don't know what they're doing like they change their require-
ment so
27:41 - Michael Kianmahd: yeah i think i have
27:42 - Michael Kianmahd: I have a solution for that.
27:45 - Michael Kianmahd: So there's like one fee structure.
27:48 - Michael Kianmahd: at a lower cost that doesn't include these enhancements.
27:51 - Michael Kianmahd: And then they're like, okay, any other enhancements will bill you
at an S.
27:54 - Michael Kianmahd: as a separate sow so what i can say i could take the lower price
now
27:59 - Lyndon: Yeah.
28:00 - Michael Kianmahd: But the risk there is if we really need something.
28:04 - Michael Kianmahd: it's not pre-negotiated and contingent on the rest of the money
flowing to them.
28:09 - Michael Kianmahd: So they may, you know, charge
28:13 - Lyndon: a
28:13 - Michael Kianmahd: ridiculous.
28:14 - Michael Kianmahd: amount later.
28:16 - Lyndon: A separate ask, Laura?
28:21 - Lyndon: Having recently been to Dreamforce.
28:24 - Lyndon: What are other alternatives for us?
28:28 - Lyndon: I mean, we're looking at renewing with a one-year.
28:31 - Lyndon: renewal, which is not a strong commitment, right?
28:36 - Lyndon: Can you brainstorm, look through your, I don't know, Rolodex isn't a real thing.
28:41 - Lyndon: But look through your virtual Rolodex to...
28:46 - Lyndon: see, hey, here's some options for the type of functionality you're looking for
that are integrated with Salesforce that...
28:55 - Lyndon: you know, maybe solutions you want to kick the tires on.
28:58 - Laura Dolphin: Okay.
28:58 - Laura Dolphin: Like you mean replacing air?
29:01 - Lyndon: Yeah, not urgent, not like next seven days type thing.
29:06 - Lyndon: But if you can add that to a task list and say, hey, just to spend.
29:10 - Lyndon: whatever, 20 to 30 minutes to brainstorm and look through.
29:16 - Lyndon: talk to others, maybe, Hey, what, what applications?
29:19 - Lyndon: And we're doing the same thing.
29:21 - Lyndon: But one of the key things would be it'd be fantastic to have solutions that
are integrated with Salesforce.
29:31 - Lyndon: Happy to.
29:33 - Lyndon: Okay.
29:34 - Lyndon: But...
29:34 - Lyndon: Michael, that sounds good.
29:36 - Lyndon: I think nailing down lower price and then my concern is that
29:41 - Lyndon: this to get the actual requirement of how we would want things to be
scalable.
29:46 - Lyndon: and have a good user experience, that all of a sudden we've created this.
29:52 - Lyndon: you know, bigger project that we're going to get a big fat bill from AIO on.
30:01 - Laura Dolphin: And remember that because it's integration too, like obviously we're
not going to bill you more because we have.
30:07 - Laura Dolphin: hours and stuff, but some of the features are just AIO.
30:11 - Laura Dolphin: Some of the features are both of us.
30:12 - Laura Dolphin: So you also have to factor in like if they make something available.
30:17 - Laura Dolphin: Like I think 0.2, great, but we actually have to build it.
30:22 - Laura Dolphin: It's not just AI on the bank feature.
30:24 - Laura Dolphin: So just calling that.
30:25 - Laura Dolphin: as well
30:26 - Lyndon: yeah
30:27 - Laura Dolphin: yeah
30:28 - Michael Kianmahd: yeah i think it also like i mean whether or not we do it just comes
with
30:31 - Michael Kianmahd: It comes down to how valuable
30:34 - Laura Dolphin: the
30:35 - Michael Kianmahd: functionality feature.
30:37 - Michael Kianmahd: sort of streamlining this does for us is.
30:42 - Michael Kianmahd: So in the conversation about nice to have versus need to have.
30:46 - Michael Kianmahd: Like it really dramatically improves the user experience.
30:49 - Michael Kianmahd: Okay, fine.
30:49 - Michael Kianmahd: You can justify that.
30:51 - Michael Kianmahd: But if the cost is $100,000, you would never do it.
30:54 - Michael Kianmahd: It's like not that much of a headache.
30:56 - Michael Kianmahd: Like it's fine.
30:57 - Laura Dolphin: And just remember that we do, we are integrating.
30:59 - Laura Dolphin: So every checklist, every step that you have in AIO, you have to
integrate.
31:02 - Laura Dolphin: having sales for so like that last modified i questioned juan and said
like well can we just like give you a dash
31:07 - Laura Dolphin: for it in Salesforce, you'll already know like, you know, who modified
it.
31:12 - Laura Dolphin: We make, you know, we can make a tweet to the integration that just
populates the user who modified it.
31:17 - Laura Dolphin: could we do that instead of asking AIO to change their platform?
31:22 - Laura Dolphin: So just like, that's why it should be
31:25 - Michael Kianmahd: possible.
31:26 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah,
31:26 - Laura Dolphin: that's what I'm saying is like understand what you're actually trying
to get
31:31 - Laura Dolphin: And if you can help me.
31:34 - Laura Dolphin: get that answer when I'm looking at you here because you're good
you're good at this I think you know what I mean like drive to the actually what are they
getting out of it and why
31:42 - Laura Dolphin: I challenge that and then come to me and then I can say, well, actually,
we can just tweak the integration and then we can just give you a dashboard.
31:48 - Laura Dolphin: for it in Salesforce rather than asking AIO to change the platform.
31:53 - Laura Dolphin: So,
31:54 - Lyndon: yeah.
31:54 - Lyndon: Makes sense.
31:55 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
31:57 - Laura Dolphin: Awesome.
31:58 - Laura Dolphin: Cool.
31:59 - Michael Kianmahd: Thank
31:59 - Lyndon: you.
31:59 - Lyndon: All
32:00 - Laura Dolphin: right.
32:00 - Laura Dolphin: Thanks, guys.
32:01 - Laura Dolphin: Enjoy the rest of your day.
32:02 - Lyndon: Thanks.
32:03 - Lyndon: Bye-bye.
