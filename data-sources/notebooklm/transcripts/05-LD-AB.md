00:20 - Laura Dolphin: Bye.
00:23 - Laura Dolphin: Hello.
00:24 - Adrian Boerstra: Hey, can you hear me?
00:26 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah, how's it going?
00:27 - Adrian Boerstra: How are you?
00:30 - Laura Dolphin: I'm going to try and stay on mute and watch.
00:34 - Adrian Boerstra: Okay.
00:35 - Laura Dolphin: It's probably pretty noisy here.
00:45 - Laura Dolphin: Oh, it's just you and me.
00:47 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah, just us kids.
00:50 - Laura Dolphin: Is it actually noisy?
00:52 - Laura Dolphin: Can you hear the
00:52 - Adrian Boerstra: background noise?
00:54 - Adrian Boerstra: No, I don't hear any noise behind you.
00:56 - Laura Dolphin: Oh, sweet.
00:58 - Laura Dolphin: How's your week?
01:00 - Adrian Boerstra: It's been good.
01:02 - Adrian Boerstra: It's been busy.
01:04 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
01:05 - Adrian Boerstra: I'm actually finding it very challenging to try and stay on top of all
of the different priorities that come up with the joint.
01:12 - Adrian Boerstra: And stand up.
01:13 - Adrian Boerstra: All the stuff that needs to get done.
01:15 - Laura Dolphin: Right.
01:19 - Adrian Boerstra: Does
01:20 - Laura Dolphin: pestering help?
01:23 - Laura Dolphin: To
01:23 - Adrian Boerstra: be honest, I mean, I quite enjoy just sort of doing this stuff and, you
know.
01:29 - Adrian Boerstra: You get the...
01:31 - Adrian Boerstra: the problem solving adrenaline going so you know i enjoy that it's
just uh
01:38 - Adrian Boerstra: it's just bad when I come out of that and go, Oh, I've dropped the
ball on three other things that came up in the meantime.
01:44 - Adrian Boerstra: But I, like, I have to shut everything else off to get focused, you know?
01:48 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah, yeah, I get it.
01:52 - Laura Dolphin: It happens.
01:53 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah.
01:53 - Laura Dolphin: Do you want me to poke one?
01:57 - Adrian Boerstra: I can actually send him a little message on chat, see if he's still
planning on joining.
02:06 - Adrian Boerstra: Teksting av
03:15 - Adrian Boerstra: I just sent him a message on chat.
03:17 - Adrian Boerstra: He hasn't seen it yet.
03:19 - Adrian Boerstra: But I'm just going to run to the bathroom real quick.
03:21 - Adrian Boerstra: So I'll be right back.
05:35 - Adrian Boerstra: Do you want to send him a text or something?
05:41 - Laura Dolphin: I don't have his number.
05:42 - Laura Dolphin: I only have him on chat.
05:44 - Adrian Boerstra: Okay.
05:44 - Adrian Boerstra: He's
05:45 - Laura Dolphin: usually responsive unless he's actually like, did he accept the meeting?
05:49 - Adrian Boerstra: And
05:49 - Laura Dolphin: was
05:51 - Adrian Boerstra: it actually
05:51 - Laura Dolphin: free?
05:51 - Laura Dolphin: He did.
05:52 - Adrian Boerstra: Jay said he wasn't going to be able to make it, but I could just meet
with Juan.
05:57 - Laura Dolphin: I can cook.
06:02 - Laura Dolphin: Let me just
06:02 - Adrian Boerstra: double check.
06:03 - Adrian Boerstra: Let me see if there was any other response from...
06:08 - Laura Dolphin: If not, I can ask someone else who sits late.
06:11 - Laura Dolphin: I can ask the people who sit next to him and just say, like, is he there?
06:15 - Laura Dolphin: He might just be like with a customer or something.
06:17 - Laura Dolphin: Sometimes that happens.
06:20 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah, he accepted it.
06:23 - Laura Dolphin: We'll make a few more minutes, otherwise.
06:26 - Laura Dolphin: I mean, I've got nowhere to go.
06:27 - Laura Dolphin: So
06:28 - Adrian Boerstra: I'm just
06:28 - Laura Dolphin: holding on.
06:31 - Adrian Boerstra: Sounds good.
06:38 - Adrian Boerstra: It was definitely nice to get through the...
06:41 - Adrian Boerstra: The EFA stuff.
06:43 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
06:44 - Laura Dolphin: Exciting.
06:45 - Laura Dolphin: I take it.
06:46 - Laura Dolphin: I don't think we're going to go live next week.
06:50 - Adrian Boerstra: Maybe they'll have to do testing and everything, but I feel like it
makes sense.
06:58 - Adrian Boerstra: Kind of, you know, there's some things that I still like.
07:05 - Laura Dolphin: Need to iron out?
07:07 - Adrian Boerstra: Well, I don't know if I need to.
07:08 - Adrian Boerstra: I think I have it ironed out the way they've expressed it, but...
07:12 - Adrian Boerstra: you know, I expect there'll be some feedback or some sort of if this
then that scenario that
07:20 - Adrian Boerstra: needs correcting but
07:21 - Laura Dolphin: yeah
07:22 - Adrian Boerstra: but anyway now that I've got like all of the
07:26 - Adrian Boerstra: queries built out and a lot and everything working then you know
as long as this is good
07:34 - Adrian Boerstra: should be pretty much similar for lease.
07:38 - Adrian Boerstra: But on the lease, I'm going to just do a whole different template.
07:42 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
07:45 - Adrian Boerstra: Okay.
07:45 - Adrian Boerstra: I should be able to basically reuse.
07:49 - Adrian Boerstra: A lot of the logic and queries and stuff that are already built.
07:54 - Laura Dolphin: Okay, good.
07:55 - Laura Dolphin: Did you see my Slack about that Nintex stuff?
07:59 - Laura Dolphin: I
07:59 - Adrian Boerstra: did.
08:01 - Adrian Boerstra: Oh,
08:01 - Laura Dolphin: okay.
08:02 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
08:02 - Laura Dolphin: Like it's incredible.
08:05 - Laura Dolphin: It's all the things that you would think it would be.
08:12 - Laura Dolphin: When it worked, the Nintex solution is like, it worked.
08:18 - Laura Dolphin: It
08:18 - Adrian Boerstra: was so
08:19 - Laura Dolphin: nice.
08:19 - Adrian Boerstra: Good.
08:21 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
08:22 - Laura Dolphin: And so Conga even like admitted they were terrible.
08:28 - Laura Dolphin: I'm just going to like watch the phone in case Swan joins.
08:31 - Laura Dolphin: They were like so.
08:32 - Laura Dolphin: So blatantly honest about just being like yeah like the roadmap's real
slim for conga composer because they're putting all their
08:40 - Laura Dolphin: dollars into their other products, which is like the Q and the contract
management.
08:45 - Adrian Boerstra: Life
08:45 - Laura Dolphin: cycle?
08:46 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
08:46 - Laura Dolphin: And then I tried to ask him a couple of questions and there was literally
not one technical person there, which is weird because every other provider had multiple
people just at the ready to be like, yeah, here's the answer to your question.
09:01 - Laura Dolphin: And they were just like, she just kept saying to me like, oh, you should
create a case.
09:06 - Laura Dolphin: Have you tried to create a case?
09:08 - Laura Dolphin: You're right here.
09:09 - Laura Dolphin: There's 10 of you.
09:11 - Laura Dolphin: I was like, you're like one of the...
09:12 - Laura Dolphin: sponsors like you'd think that they would be.
09:15 - Laura Dolphin: it was it was shocking and then I like I kind of asked I like felt that out
about that like I asked about it and they were just like yeah we've heard the same which is
because they've been in the market for so long
09:27 - Laura Dolphin: that they've got like the brand yeah
09:30 - Adrian Boerstra: there really is so much like I don't
09:32 - Adrian Boerstra: there's so much trial and error as you go like okay I'm going to try
this because
09:38 - Laura Dolphin: so
09:38 - Adrian Boerstra: many different little
09:40 - Adrian Boerstra: things that could be wrong.
09:42 - Adrian Boerstra: But, you know, I got into a workflow where I was able to start to solve
things pretty quick.
09:47 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah, but it was insane.
09:49 - Laura Dolphin: And then I asked her a few questions just like that, like what you and
I have been going through.
09:53 - Laura Dolphin: I was like, do you recommend to your customers that they like use
the text versions of Word instead of Word?
09:58 - Laura Dolphin: Because like if statements and stuff are so difficult and she was like,
yeah, but like it didn't really sound like she'd ever heard it before.
10:04 - Laura Dolphin: You know what I mean?
10:05 - Laura Dolphin: Like it sounded
10:05 - Adrian Boerstra: like she
10:06 - Laura Dolphin: was just flopping.
10:07 - Laura Dolphin: Like, okay.
10:09 - Adrian Boerstra: And
10:09 - Laura Dolphin: then I asked them about like if statements and I was like, they just
seem so difficult and stuff.
10:13 - Laura Dolphin: She's like, oh, well, she usually uses all the...
10:16 - Laura Dolphin: Like queries?
10:17 - Laura Dolphin: like that's what she said she uses queries instead so that it evaluates
it
10:22 - Laura Dolphin: like before
10:24 - Adrian Boerstra: yeah
10:25 - Laura Dolphin: but yeah so and i was like okay but but then that nintex thing oh my
god you should see it like i was like oh my god can i switch it's so easy
10:33 - Adrian Boerstra: to
10:33 - Laura Dolphin: use like it's it's insane and like the stuff that you can like click and like
the it even diagrams your objects for you and like literally like a little like lucid chart erd kind
of style
10:43 - Adrian Boerstra: yeah yeah and
10:44 - Laura Dolphin: then you can like set your field like
10:46 - Adrian Boerstra: it's the human mind in
10:50 - Laura Dolphin: yeah and it was just built for like For sales.
10:52 - Laura Dolphin: It's worse, right?
10:52 - Laura Dolphin: Like, oh, God.
10:53 - Laura Dolphin: I mean,
10:53 - Adrian Boerstra: honestly, I feel like I've definitely conquered conga.
10:59 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
11:00 - Adrian Boerstra: But, like, there's a certain level of satisfaction, but at the same time,
I wouldn't be too butthurt about.
11:06 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
11:07 - Laura Dolphin: moving
11:08 - Adrian Boerstra: yeah
11:09 - Laura Dolphin: so anyways I found a good one if like if we get to the point when we
feel like it might be like you know they're coming up for renewal and we're like
11:16 - Laura Dolphin: this is just like you're not sustainable for you
11:20 - Adrian Boerstra: unfortunately it probably won't deliver a great return i
11:25 - Laura Dolphin: know all of
11:26 - Adrian Boerstra: this work maybe we did all of this it probably would have been
worthwhile but
11:31 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
11:31 - Laura Dolphin: Well, but I'm just throwing it out there.
11:33 - Laura Dolphin: If you ever have customers.
11:35 - Laura Dolphin: share the word if they're looking for Nintex.
11:38 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah, Nintex, I think.
11:41 - Laura Dolphin: Nintex?
11:42 - Laura Dolphin: Nintex?
11:42 - Laura Dolphin: Something like that, yeah.
11:43 - Laura Dolphin: Let's see if we
11:44 - Adrian Boerstra: can put it in there.
11:46 - Laura Dolphin: I put it in a Slack message too, like a day or two ago.
11:50 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
11:56 - Laura Dolphin: Have
11:56 - Adrian Boerstra: we had that many messages going back?
11:58 - Adrian Boerstra: No,
11:59 - Laura Dolphin: I don't think so.
12:00 - Laura Dolphin: Maybe it just didn't send.
12:01 - Laura Dolphin: I don't know.
12:02 - Adrian Boerstra: No, no, I got it.
12:03 - Adrian Boerstra: I got it.
12:04 - Laura Dolphin: Oh, okay.
12:04 - Adrian Boerstra: I saw it, however you sent it.
12:08 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
12:10 - Adrian Boerstra: I just don't see it in our one-on-one chat.
12:12 - Adrian Boerstra: Oh.
12:12 - Adrian Boerstra: Was it in
12:13 - Laura Dolphin: the group
12:14 - Adrian Boerstra: chat?
12:15 - Laura Dolphin: No, I might have put it in like with other messages though.
12:22 - Laura Dolphin: I
12:22 - Adrian Boerstra: mean, it was definitely this week.
12:26 - Adrian Boerstra: Oh, there it is.
12:27 - Adrian Boerstra: Nintex.
12:27 - Laura Dolphin: Oh, yeah, yeah.
12:29 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah, Nintex.
12:30 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
12:31 - Adrian Boerstra: That's two days ago.
12:32 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah, yeah.
12:34 - Laura Dolphin: All right, it doesn't look like Juan's gonna turn up.
12:38 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah, all right.
12:40 - Adrian Boerstra: Well, I mean, yeah, I mean, I...
12:44 - Adrian Boerstra: I'm using, so maybe I'll just fill you in on a couple of things.
12:49 - Adrian Boerstra: So using the LLC.
12:51 - Adrian Boerstra: See?
12:52 - Laura Dolphin: Okay.
12:53 - Laura Dolphin: I can see my phone if you want to like bring anything.
12:57 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
12:57 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
12:58 - Laura Dolphin: Cause I'll be back Monday and I can.
13:00 - Laura Dolphin: kind of help with like testing and stuff too.
13:07 - Adrian Boerstra: I don't like this keyboard.
13:09 - Adrian Boerstra: It's not working.
13:36 - Adrian Boerstra: I don't
13:37 - Laura Dolphin: know where it goes.
13:41 - Laura Dolphin: I would have said...
13:52 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah, he hasn't even seen my chat yet.
13:57 - Laura Dolphin: Maybe he is he like, he's not out today or anything, is he?
14:01 - Adrian Boerstra: No, well, like I said,
14:03 - Laura Dolphin: accepted.
14:09 - Laura Dolphin: Maybe he just went for lunch and forgot.
14:13 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah.
14:15 - Adrian Boerstra: That's certainly possible.
14:17 - Laura Dolphin: Rude.
14:21 - Laura Dolphin: He's going to get extra tasks assigned to Sir Missing.
14:26 - Adrian Boerstra: I've disappointed a lot of other people while working on this.
14:29 - Laura Dolphin: Oh, good.
14:32 - Laura Dolphin: That makes me feel good.
14:35 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
14:35 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
14:36 - Laura Dolphin: Well, you need available work, right?
14:38 - Adrian Boerstra: I did.
14:40 - Laura Dolphin: You're like, I don't anymore.
14:41 - Laura Dolphin: So.
14:43 - Adrian Boerstra: Well, yeah, it's.
14:46 - Adrian Boerstra: It's interesting.
14:48 - Adrian Boerstra: I try to be accommodating.
14:53 - Adrian Boerstra: And once
14:54 - Laura Dolphin: I get
14:54 - Adrian Boerstra: going on things, it's like, I realized that just logistically, it's so hard
to turn off like.
15:00 - Adrian Boerstra: the joint really like right now I've got to get SOWs out the door like
and we had a draft ready and then they asked for some other revisions but I've got people
on the bench waiting until this gets done
15:15 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah, I get it.
15:16 - Laura Dolphin: But like, why are you doing those?
15:17 - Laura Dolphin: I don't like, isn't that what the account?
15:21 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah, Corey's off right now as it
15:24 - Laura Dolphin: happened to me.
15:25 - Adrian Boerstra: But I always, like I'm always doing like the SOWs themselves, like
coming up with the scope, working with the team, and then I'll check it with the client.
15:34 - Adrian Boerstra: So by the time Corey's drafting it and setting it over, it's already.
15:39 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah,
15:39 - Laura Dolphin: I get it.
15:40 - Laura Dolphin: I do that for most of mine too.
15:42 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah, yeah.
15:42 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
15:44 - Laura Dolphin: I'm not going to say much more because I get in trouble with these
things.
15:50 - Adrian Boerstra: Why am I...
15:54 - Adrian Boerstra: There we go.
15:55 - Adrian Boerstra: Four.
15:56 - Adrian Boerstra: Okay.
16:10 - Adrian Boerstra: All right, here we go.
16:11 - Adrian Boerstra: I'm in.
16:13 - Adrian Boerstra: And let me share.
16:26 - Adrian Boerstra: All right.
16:27 - Adrian Boerstra: So at one point, I almost went back on the whole, no, just leave LLC
one and two.
16:34 - Adrian Boerstra: because there was a couple of sections where
16:38 - Adrian Boerstra: in the
16:38 - Laura Dolphin: template
16:39 - Adrian Boerstra: I needed actually to have an explicit
16:42 - Adrian Boerstra: to like where the template was different other than having more
signature blocks actually was different if there was more than one
16:50 - Laura Dolphin: versus
16:51 - Adrian Boerstra: two, which meant I needed to have a discrete value somewhere.
16:55 - Adrian Boerstra: but I ended up doing it a different way so we can stick with the
simplified.
17:01 - Adrian Boerstra: Okay,
17:01 - Laura Dolphin: I'll bring that up on Monday at the steering committee with the team
and just say, can anybody think of another reason why you need it split up other than the
docs?
17:10 - Laura Dolphin: just in case because they might, I don't, yeah.
17:14 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah, and I asked Juan again after our
17:17 - Laura Dolphin: conversation,
17:18 - Adrian Boerstra: and
17:18 - Laura Dolphin: he
17:18 - Adrian Boerstra: still said, yeah, no, that should be okay.
17:22 - Adrian Boerstra: but
17:22 - Laura Dolphin: yeah,
17:23 - Adrian Boerstra: you can ask others.
17:24 - Adrian Boerstra: So, um, so what that means is if you go to, yeah, we go to the
account.
17:29 - Adrian Boerstra: then what I've done is I've made Fabius GN LLC.
17:33 - Laura Dolphin: See?
17:35 - Adrian Boerstra: All right.
17:36 - Adrian Boerstra: And you'll see that, or sorry, that's Laura Thursdays is an LLC.
17:40 - Adrian Boerstra: ¿Sí?
17:40 - Laura Dolphin: Sí.
17:43 - Adrian Boerstra: And if we go into that opportunity.
17:47 - Adrian Boerstra: I've also made, I think, Fabius G.
17:52 - Adrian Boerstra: One of them is an LLC and one of them is a corp.
17:56 - Adrian Boerstra: Because the template follows the company who is signing it, not
the applicant.
18:03 - Adrian Boerstra: So what that means is, yeah, if I can, yeah, you get it.
18:10 - Adrian Boerstra: So we're checking on each one of those.
18:12 - Laura Dolphin: Nice.
18:13 - Adrian Boerstra: See if they're an LLC or a corp to present the right template.
18:17 - Adrian Boerstra: All right.
18:20 - Adrian Boerstra: And it's all in.
18:21 - Adrian Boerstra: I'm going to show you actually what.
18:25 - Adrian Boerstra: I'll show you what the Word template actually looks like.
18:40 - Adrian Boerstra: All right.
18:41 - Laura Dolphin: Let
18:43 - Adrian Boerstra: me call F9 so everything shows.
18:50 - Adrian Boerstra: There we go.
18:52 - Adrian Boerstra: So I updated this logic now, so it's not looking for LLC1 and LLC2
and stuff.
18:58 - Laura Dolphin: Yep.
18:59 - Adrian Boerstra: The other thing I've learned how to do is to actually nest them
properly so that it works.
19:05 - Adrian Boerstra: I couldn't find it in the documentation, but...
19:07 - Laura Dolphin: Okay.
19:11 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah, so here we're looking at the individual.
19:17 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah, I mean, I won't get into the details, but that's looking.
19:21 - Adrian Boerstra: But now what I do is I have a table.
19:26 - Adrian Boerstra: And I added another conga query that figures out how many.
19:33 - Adrian Boerstra: How many do we have?
19:37 - Adrian Boerstra: Then it shows one thing.
19:39 - Adrian Boerstra: If it's more than one.
19:41 - Adrian Boerstra: then it shows another thing.
19:42 - Adrian Boerstra: And that's just the first example where it says debtor versus as
debtor primary residence.
19:47 - Adrian Boerstra: for whatever reason, this shows up if there's more than one.
19:52 - Adrian Boerstra: All right.
19:54 - Adrian Boerstra: And then that's everything else that you would expect.
19:59 - Adrian Boerstra: Made updates here, so we have the proper lines showing the whole
thing.
20:03 - Laura Dolphin: So
20:03 - Adrian Boerstra: this is pulling anyone who's a debtor lessee corporate.
20:09 - Adrian Boerstra: Better or less the individual.
20:12 - Adrian Boerstra: Now I've updated the conca query so debtorlessieindividual shows
anybody who has a signing order number beside them.
20:21 - Adrian Boerstra: So like if there were a referral, they won't show up.
20:26 - Adrian Boerstra: But if they're in the signing order anywhere, then they are also going
to show.
20:30 - Adrian Boerstra: Oh, hang on.
20:32 - Adrian Boerstra: No.
20:32 - Adrian Boerstra: So not here on the guarantor individual, sorry.
20:37 - Adrian Boerstra: So debtor lessee, this is just if they have the role of debtor lessee
individual.
20:42 - Laura Dolphin: Yep.
20:42 - Adrian Boerstra: Okay.
20:43 - Adrian Boerstra: There
20:43 - Laura Dolphin: should pretty much only be one.
20:45 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah.
20:46 - Adrian Boerstra: Moving on, we got guarantor corporate, which if they have a role of
guarantor corporate, then they show up in here.
20:57 - Adrian Boerstra: Now one little thing that could come up is I've got this.
21:02 - Adrian Boerstra: pulling from the title in on the contact.
21:07 - Adrian Boerstra: In some documents, it just has, instead of...
21:12 - Adrian Boerstra: having title populate from the database.
21:15 - Adrian Boerstra: It just has the signature.
21:17 - Adrian Boerstra: So we may want to change this to just the DocuSign thing so that
they fill in their title at signing as opposed to pulling it from the database.
21:26 - Laura Dolphin: Okay, that's a question for them.
21:28 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah.
21:28 - Adrian Boerstra: So that's one thing that I have a question about.
21:32 - Adrian Boerstra: And then a guarantor individual.
21:36 - Adrian Boerstra: This is the one that I've updated.
21:37 - Adrian Boerstra: So this conga query will return anybody who has a signing number
anywhere.
21:45 - Adrian Boerstra: So if they are, remember how they were saying how everybody has
to sign as an individual guarantor?
21:51 - Adrian Boerstra: if they are assigning anything.
21:55 - Adrian Boerstra: So the guarantor query, guarantor individual query now takes
anybody.
22:01 - Adrian Boerstra: regardless of
22:04 - Adrian Boerstra: their role as long as they have a number beside them.
22:09 - Laura Dolphin: I thought that there was an if statement in there, like only if it's under
like the company or something like that.
22:15 - Laura Dolphin: Like, I don't think that's applicable, you know, but I would just, yeah, I
would question that.
22:22 - Laura Dolphin: But if they say that's what
22:23 - Adrian Boerstra: it
22:23 - Laura Dolphin: is.
22:24 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah, I asked, I questioned it
22:28 - Laura Dolphin: sideways.
22:29 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
22:30 - Adrian Boerstra: The only thing about this right now, and I can fix this, I was going
to fix it once you have the logic is if you put in the same person as two roles.
22:39 - Laura Dolphin: Yes.
22:40 - Adrian Boerstra: Right now, they're going to show up twice as an individual guarantor.
22:45 - Adrian Boerstra: So I'll probably make an adjustment to this so that it only returns
the first
22:54 - Adrian Boerstra: I'll group by signing number.
22:58 - Laura Dolphin: Well, just remember, though, the logic in full copy is now as you wanted
it to be.
23:02 - Laura Dolphin: You probably just need to update that opportunity.
23:04 - Laura Dolphin: So if you assign Laura Dolphin, she
23:06 - Adrian Boerstra: will
23:06 - Laura Dolphin: hold the same number.
23:08 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
23:08 - Adrian Boerstra: Okay, perfect.
23:09 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah.
23:10 - Adrian Boerstra: So I just have to add a group by under that query and then it won't
occur twice.
23:15 - Adrian Boerstra: I'll just group now by.
23:17 - Adrian Boerstra: the signing number.
23:18 - Laura Dolphin: I don't
23:19 - Adrian Boerstra: have to make any changes here.
23:20 - Adrian Boerstra: I just do that in the query.
23:22 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
23:23 - Laura Dolphin: All
23:23 - Adrian Boerstra: right, moving on.
23:26 - Adrian Boerstra: This part then shows up.
23:28 - Adrian Boerstra: No matter what.
23:32 - Adrian Boerstra: That part shows up no matter what.
23:35 - Adrian Boerstra: All right, here, if it's an LLC,
23:36 - Adrian Boerstra: Sí.
23:39 - Adrian Boerstra: then this shows up like this, but only if DL, the debtor lessee count,
is one.
23:48 - Adrian Boerstra: Right?
23:51 - Adrian Boerstra: It
23:51 - Laura Dolphin: doesn't matter if it's individual or business?
23:55 - Adrian Boerstra: Well, it's only LLC, so there wouldn't be individual, right?
24:00 - Laura Dolphin: Oh, I'm sorry.
24:01 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah, okay.
24:02 - Adrian Boerstra: Okay, so yep, so that's if it's one.
24:06 - Adrian Boerstra: If there's, this is the one where I had to figure out a way, like I had to
nest queries.
24:11 - Adrian Boerstra: So I have an if here and an if here.
24:15 - Laura Dolphin: So
24:16 - Adrian Boerstra: anyway, yeah, so that shows up if it's only one, but if it's more than
one.
24:22 - Adrian Boerstra: any number, this is what comes up.
24:27 - Adrian Boerstra: This whole section.
24:29 - Adrian Boerstra: Only for LLC.
24:30 - Adrian Boerstra: Sim.
24:32 - Adrian Boerstra: And this is where now you're going to see that title.
24:35 - Laura Dolphin: It's
24:36 - Adrian Boerstra: spelled by DocuSign.
24:38 - Adrian Boerstra: It isn't populated from...
24:40 - Adrian Boerstra: from the system.
24:43 - Adrian Boerstra: So if they want us to standardize one way or another on that, we
can.
24:46 - Laura Dolphin: Okay.
24:47 - Adrian Boerstra: And then here, this always shows the first one, whoever is first in
the signing order.
24:53 - Adrian Boerstra: and then down below it's going to show
24:58 - Adrian Boerstra: anybody in order if they're as long as they were with like if they're in
the debtor lessee list.
25:08 - Laura Dolphin: Okay.
25:09 - Adrian Boerstra: Okay, moving down.
25:12 - Adrian Boerstra: Now we have the guarantor section for corporate.
25:17 - Adrian Boerstra: And on this one, you're going to get if you have multiple companies
like on behalf of companies.
25:25 - Adrian Boerstra: Then they'll each get their own page and the contacts inside of them
will be grouped.
25:33 - Adrian Boerstra: by the company that they're with.
25:35 - Adrian Boerstra: So if there's multiple signers for a certain one, then that section gets
repeated.
25:41 - Laura Dolphin: I feel like this is going to, like, it takes away how many documents?
25:47 - Adrian Boerstra: A lot.
25:48 - Adrian Boerstra: Like it takes away.
25:50 - Adrian Boerstra: Well, so first you're going to get, you don't have to worry about LLC
individual or corp anymore.
25:57 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
25:58 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
25:59 - Adrian Boerstra: So each one of those has about like
26:02 - Laura Dolphin: six, eight, I think.
26:04 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah.
26:04 - Adrian Boerstra: Several documents,
26:06 - Laura Dolphin: each
26:06 - Adrian Boerstra: of them.
26:07 - Adrian Boerstra: So,
26:07 - Laura Dolphin: yeah.
26:08 - Laura Dolphin: Okay.
26:08 - Laura Dolphin: This was the goal.
26:09 - Laura Dolphin: You've reached the, you've reached it.
26:13 - Adrian Boerstra: And that's everything.
26:14 - Adrian Boerstra: That's everything in the EFA.
26:16 - Laura Dolphin: Amazing.
26:17 - Laura Dolphin: Amazing.
26:18 - Laura Dolphin: And then like the lease.
26:19 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
26:19 - Laura Dolphin: The lease, as soon as they say yes, and the lease is pretty much just
like copy paste.
26:23 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah.
26:25 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah.
26:25 - Adrian Boerstra: The lease, uh, because yeah, the lease contracts are.
26:30 - Adrian Boerstra: I don't know.
26:31 - Adrian Boerstra: Until I come up, I might find some surprises in it, but...
26:35 - Adrian Boerstra: The queries are all going to be basically the
26:39 - Laura Dolphin: The same.
26:40 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
26:40 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
26:40 - Laura Dolphin: It's just the language and the actual contract itself.
26:43 - Laura Dolphin: Like it'll say like, you know, you're less, lessy or whatever.
26:47 - Laura Dolphin: Like it'll
26:47 - Adrian Boerstra: just be
26:48 - Laura Dolphin: verbiage and probably the terms themselves, but everything else I
believe is just the exact same.
26:53 - Laura Dolphin: And then the deal will just be structured differently.
26:55 - Laura Dolphin: which means that you probably won't have like, like the same number
of guarantors and stuff like that, but that doesn't matter.
27:02 - Laura Dolphin: So.
27:05 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah.
27:05 - Adrian Boerstra: So I've looked after those three.
27:08 - Adrian Boerstra: Then I've looked after scenarios where there's one or many guar-
antors, stuff like that.
27:14 - Adrian Boerstra: And there should be no deleting of anything.
27:17 - Laura Dolphin: Yes.
27:18 - Laura Dolphin: Okay.
27:18 - Adrian Boerstra: So they didn't have to manually go in and delete anything.
27:21 - Adrian Boerstra: It's dynamic enough to handle any scenarios they've told me about.
27:26 - Adrian Boerstra: All right.
27:27 - Adrian Boerstra: So we'll go ahead and do it.
27:28 - Adrian Boerstra: I've renamed this to create contract EFA.
27:31 - Adrian Boerstra: Okay.
27:32 - Laura Dolphin: Nice.
27:38 - Adrian Boerstra: At this point, there's no dynamic template selection.
27:40 - Adrian Boerstra: I mean, I'm using the formula field still.
27:44 - Adrian Boerstra: but the only one in it right now is Master EFA.
27:47 - Adrian Boerstra: Because
27:47 - Laura Dolphin: that's all you really need, right?
27:49 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah.
27:49 - Adrian Boerstra: I mean, again, I'm going to have a separate template here for lease.
27:54 - Adrian Boerstra: So really that formula field.
27:59 - Laura Dolphin: It's just
27:59 - Adrian Boerstra: going to determine whether it's an EFA or whether it's a lease and
it's going to be an appropriate template.
28:06 - Adrian Boerstra: But same, everything from leasing is going to be down to one.
28:10 - Laura Dolphin: Sure.
28:10 - Laura Dolphin: If it's easier, because then you don't, the button itself will say create
contract EFA versus lease.
28:16 - Laura Dolphin: If it's easier to just like have a different button, I can control that with
like record.
28:22 - Adrian Boerstra: I mean, that will say create contract because it'll use
28:27 - Laura Dolphin: the
28:27 - Adrian Boerstra: field to determine whether it's EFA or lease.
28:30 - Laura Dolphin: Cool.
28:30 - Laura Dolphin: All
28:32 - Adrian Boerstra: right.
28:32 - Adrian Boerstra: So we'll just generate it as a PDF.
28:42 - Laura Dolphin: Exciting.
28:49 - Laura Dolphin: There
28:49 - Adrian Boerstra: we go.
28:51 - Adrian Boerstra: So it's brought in Laura Thursdays as debtor.
28:54 - Adrian Boerstra: I should have just double checked how we've got this here.
28:59 - Adrian Boerstra: Just keep it ready.
29:00 - Adrian Boerstra: So we're using LLC because...
29:04 - Adrian Boerstra: Laura Thursday is an LLC.
29:06 - Adrian Boerstra: ¿Sí?
29:06 - Laura Dolphin: Угу.
29:10 - Adrian Boerstra: All right, it's pulled in the collateral.
29:15 - Adrian Boerstra: That is all standard.
29:18 - Adrian Boerstra: You've got debtor.
29:21 - Adrian Boerstra: This is going to be like corporate debtor, I guess.
29:24 - Adrian Boerstra: We can...
29:26 - Adrian Boerstra: We have, yeah, corporate debtor.
29:32 - Adrian Boerstra: There we go.
29:33 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah, that looks
29:34 - Adrian Boerstra: good.
29:36 - Laura Dolphin: And then these are the corporate guarantors.
29:38 - Adrian Boerstra: These are corporate guarantors.
29:39 - Adrian Boerstra: So right now I just have guarantor corporate.
29:43 - Adrian Boerstra: each one of those I don't know how they want if they want me to
get rid of that or delineate it but for testing purposes it was much easier to put in there
29:54 - Adrian Boerstra: Okay.
29:55 - Adrian Boerstra: What section is specifically repeating?
29:57 - Adrian Boerstra: Okay.
30:01 - Adrian Boerstra: Guarantor individual.
30:03 - Adrian Boerstra: So now you should see anybody who is a debtor lessee.
30:07 - Adrian Boerstra: So now this is going to include
30:12 - Adrian Boerstra: This is going to include Laura 2 dolphin and Laura dolphin.
30:18 - Laura Dolphin: And
30:18 - Adrian Boerstra: there's Laura too, and there's Laura.
30:20 - Laura Dolphin: Okay.
30:21 - Laura Dolphin: So the, sorry, the doc said this comes from, what is the verbiage in
there?
30:29 - Adrian Boerstra: Well, this is stuff that they delete and add in in order to get this.
30:35 - Adrian Boerstra: This stuff is exactly the same.
30:40 - Adrian Boerstra: And then above
30:40 - Laura Dolphin: they
30:41 - Adrian Boerstra: just have like this.
30:43 - Laura Dolphin: Right.
30:44 - Laura Dolphin: Okay.
30:45 - Adrian Boerstra: They just have that line and then they just have each of the
signatures.
30:48 - Adrian Boerstra: They don't have.
30:50 - Laura Dolphin: Okay.
30:50 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
30:50 - Laura Dolphin: They'll probably won't want that, but just leave it for now.
30:53 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah.
30:53 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah.
30:53 - Adrian Boerstra: It's just more for testing that it's easier to have that in there.
30:56 - Laura Dolphin: Okay.
30:57 - Adrian Boerstra: Repeating that whole section for anybody that got returned by the
all signers query.
31:06 - Adrian Boerstra: Sorry.
31:09 - Adrian Boerstra: The guarantor individual is the one that has everybody.
31:17 - Adrian Boerstra: have a
31:17 - Laura Dolphin: just have a role yeah
31:19 - Adrian Boerstra: yeah and yeah because laura too is a yeah so that's working properly
yeah
31:26 - Adrian Boerstra: Yep.
31:27 - Adrian Boerstra: Cool.
31:28 - Adrian Boerstra: At the end of all of those, we get that little creditor section.
31:31 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
31:32 - Adrian Boerstra: the invoice that shows up in all cases, and then this is the one that
shows up if the
31:37 - Adrian Boerstra: See if it's an LLC but with only one debtor lessee signer.
31:46 - Laura Dolphin: Okay.
31:47 - Laura Dolphin: I mean, I don't, I'm just,
31:48 - Adrian Boerstra: I'm
31:49 - Laura Dolphin: taking
31:49 - Adrian Boerstra: your saying
31:50 - Laura Dolphin: at face.
31:50 - Laura Dolphin: I have no idea.
31:53 - Adrian Boerstra: Like, I don't know why it's different.
31:55 - Adrian Boerstra: Really.
31:56 - Adrian Boerstra: It doesn't have any heading or anything on it, but this is exactly what
it looks like in the existing.
32:01 - Adrian Boerstra: template just has one page looking like this
32:05 - Laura Dolphin: does it it doesn't have a header
32:06 - Adrian Boerstra: no it's the no header it's just the consent it's the template that's
called uh
32:12 - Adrian Boerstra: the EFA LLC Consent One.
32:20 - Laura Dolphin: Interesting.
32:21 - Laura Dolphin: Okay.
32:22 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah.
32:22 - Adrian Boerstra: But if I was to...
32:24 - Adrian Boerstra: to, yeah, but if you had multiple, then it has a header and it has this
and then you repeat multiple signatures below it.
32:39 - Adrian Boerstra: The guarantee and unanimous consent for all members.
32:43 - Adrian Boerstra: And there it is.
32:44 - Adrian Boerstra: There's only one person.
32:45 - Adrian Boerstra: Again, notice here I've used just T2.
32:48 - Adrian Boerstra: So I'm letting them
32:50 - Laura Dolphin: put the
32:50 - Adrian Boerstra: title in.
32:52 - Adrian Boerstra: and for whatever reason in the original doesn't ask for a title
32:57 - Adrian Boerstra: for here
32:59 - Laura Dolphin: but
32:59 - Adrian Boerstra: that's just the way it is
33:01 - Laura Dolphin: yeah that's fine
33:05 - Adrian Boerstra: Looks like we do have two guarantors that are with this company.
33:11 - Laura Dolphin: Fabi S.G.
33:13 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah, so Fabi S.G.
33:14 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah.
33:16 - Laura Dolphin: Is that pulling from the on behalf of though?
33:19 - Adrian Boerstra: Yes.
33:20 - Laura Dolphin: That's the account name.
33:22 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah, on behalf of.
33:24 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah, it's actually...
33:25 - Adrian Boerstra: Hey.
33:28 - Adrian Boerstra: What's the difference between the, oh yeah, the on behalf of, that's
a good point.
33:32 - Adrian Boerstra: The on behalf of.
33:35 - Adrian Boerstra: It's specific.
33:37 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah.
33:38 - Adrian Boerstra: Okay.
33:39 - Adrian Boerstra: I'll have to double check.
33:40 - Adrian Boerstra: In most cases that I did.
33:43 - Adrian Boerstra: get it from on behalf of, but I'll have to double check and make sure.
33:46 - Laura Dolphin: Okay, so that's the one it should be using for...
33:51 - Laura Dolphin: all of them
33:52 - Adrian Boerstra: yeah give me one give me one second there's probably some where
i'm not
33:57 - Adrian Boerstra: So it's
33:57 - Laura Dolphin: a good example.
34:00 - Laura Dolphin: Like you can check the deck one where it says like Akyar Inc.
34:04 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah, let's just take a quick, quick piece
34:07 - Laura Dolphin: of
34:07 - Adrian Boerstra: that one.
34:17 - Laura Dolphin: There's an on behalf of account name.
34:21 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah, so that's obviously on behalf of the state.
34:27 - Adrian Boerstra: Actually, I'd have to, okay, I'll check this afterwards because I have
to actually pull up the view data.
34:33 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah, that's fine.
34:35 - Laura Dolphin: Just double check that it's pulling from like that, right?
34:37 - Laura Dolphin: Because yeah, that's the one that if they have related accounts.
34:41 - Laura Dolphin: then we want to make sure that they can set it and then it's pulling
from that.
34:46 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah.
34:47 - Adrian Boerstra: Okay.
34:48 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah.
34:49 - Adrian Boerstra: I'll double check.
34:49 - Adrian Boerstra: I'll double check.
34:51 - Adrian Boerstra: That'd be one to miss because in most cases it's the same, but
there's going to be the odd case where it's different, right?
34:57 - Adrian Boerstra: It'll
34:57 - Laura Dolphin: be 90% the same, but it'll be the same.
35:00 - Adrian Boerstra: Actually, well, no, because...
35:03 - Adrian Boerstra: Because DEC.
35:14 - Adrian Boerstra: Então...
35:16 - Adrian Boerstra: See, we made his on behalf of ACAR, but as a deck.
35:22 - Adrian Boerstra: Okay.
35:24 - Adrian Boerstra: If we're seeing AKR and it means it's, it is pulling it from the proper
thing.
35:28 - Laura Dolphin: Okay.
35:28 - Laura Dolphin: It's probably just worth it.
35:29 - Laura Dolphin: I saw one that just looked like it was showing just the, the standard
account name.
35:34 - Laura Dolphin: So maybe just like worth of control F for like a count.
35:38 - Laura Dolphin: Something like that.
35:40 - Laura Dolphin: Where
35:40 - Adrian Boerstra: did it, here we go.
35:42 - Laura Dolphin: So.
35:46 - Laura Dolphin: This is the merged one.
35:48 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah.
35:49 - Adrian Boerstra: So if we look at them, that's the one we want to see it.
35:51 - Adrian Boerstra: It's got a
35:52 - Laura Dolphin: character.
35:53 - Laura Dolphin: Perfect.
35:54 - Adrian Boerstra: Okay.
35:54 - Adrian Boerstra: Perfect.
35:57 - Laura Dolphin: Nice.
35:59 - Adrian Boerstra: And then this is his, but this is his name.
36:01 - Adrian Boerstra: So let's put on that.
36:05 - Laura Dolphin: Cool.
36:06 - Adrian Boerstra: That's the whole
36:08 - Laura Dolphin: thing.
36:09 - Laura Dolphin: Good job.
36:10 - Laura Dolphin: Okay, I will...
36:13 - Laura Dolphin: If Juan responds and you want to jump on with him today, please do
so.
36:18 - Laura Dolphin: and like just go for it have him like review with him I wouldn't do like
the merge I would
36:25 - Adrian Boerstra: just I don't have time I've got to get this stuff done for the joint now
so
36:29 - Laura Dolphin: okay then yeah don't worry about it um I will reach out just tell Juan
I will reach out and I'll schedule something with him for Monday um and I might actually
show this on the steering committee just so that everyone can kind of like get a glance on it
36:43 - Laura Dolphin: and see.
36:44 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
36:44 - Laura Dolphin: Okay, cool.
36:45 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
36:46 - Laura Dolphin: I can
36:46 - Adrian Boerstra: kind
36:46 - Laura Dolphin: of take
36:47 - Adrian Boerstra: the testing.
36:47 - Adrian Boerstra: I think it's probably at least a dozen or so.
36:52 - Adrian Boerstra: templates that went into this.
36:56 - Laura Dolphin: Amazing.
36:57 - Adrian Boerstra: So.
36:58 - Laura Dolphin: Amazing.
36:59 - Laura Dolphin: That's what I wanted.
37:00 - Laura Dolphin: Okay.
37:00 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
37:01 - Laura Dolphin: If you hear from Juan, just tell him that I'll schedule something with
him for Monday.
37:06 - Laura Dolphin: and I will let you know kind of like next steps.
37:10 - Laura Dolphin: I'll put you on it as optional if I do meet with them.
37:13 - Laura Dolphin: Otherwise, I'll just kind of like poke you and say, I need this, I need that.
37:17 - Laura Dolphin: We're ready for the next.
37:18 - Laura Dolphin: the least.
37:19 - Laura Dolphin: Are you going to have some time next week?
37:22 - Adrian Boerstra: I should.
37:23 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah.
37:23 - Adrian Boerstra: So look at Conga Solutions.
37:25 - Adrian Boerstra: So just so you know, I've got placeholders here already.
37:28 - Adrian Boerstra: So create contract, create broker docs, create dealer docs, and
create POA.
37:33 - Laura Dolphin: Okay, cool.
37:34 - Adrian Boerstra: POA is, I don't think PO, oh no, I guess there might be some
conditions in POA.
37:43 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah.
37:44 - Adrian Boerstra: So, but those, you know, those are next, but I think these are much
simpler.
37:48 - Adrian Boerstra: Like we, this, this one contract really gets most of the heavy lifting
out of the way.
37:55 - Laura Dolphin: Correct.
37:55 - Adrian Boerstra: Knock on wood.
37:57 - Laura Dolphin: Okay.
37:57 - Laura Dolphin: So you didn't do the Excel spreadsheet for like the dealer broker docs.
38:01 - Laura Dolphin: You didn't do that yet though.
38:03 - Adrian Boerstra: No.
38:04 - Laura Dolphin: Okay.
38:05 - Laura Dolphin: I can
38:05 - Adrian Boerstra: probably take
38:06 - Laura Dolphin: a stab at that.
38:07 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah, yeah.
38:08 - Adrian Boerstra: But I don't think they have, like, variable numbers of signers and all
kinds of stuff like that.
38:13 - Adrian Boerstra: And, like...
38:15 - Adrian Boerstra: like the POAs need like wet signatures.
38:19 - Adrian Boerstra: So it's just.
38:21 - Adrian Boerstra: basically, you know, and I was just gonna, I'm not gonna come do a
big combination.
38:28 - Adrian Boerstra: I'm just gonna make sure that this solution bundles all together the
ones that they need.
38:32 - Laura Dolphin: Okay.
38:33 - Laura Dolphin: Okay.
38:33 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
38:34 - Laura Dolphin: Maybe we can focus on those next week so that we have the EFA fully
working with like the dealer and broker and power of attorney docs.
38:41 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah.
38:42 - Laura Dolphin: Okay, cool.
38:43 - Adrian Boerstra: Okay.
38:44 - Laura Dolphin: Awesome.
38:44 - Laura Dolphin: Thank you.
38:45 - Adrian Boerstra: All right.
38:45 - Laura Dolphin: Have a
38:46 - Adrian Boerstra: great weekend.
38:47 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah, you too.
38:48 - Laura Dolphin: Okay, bye.
38:49 - Laura Dolphin: Okay, bye.
