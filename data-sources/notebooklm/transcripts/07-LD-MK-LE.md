Maxim x Faye Planning Transcript
00:02 - Laura Dolphin: Is Carlos joining?
00:03 - Laura Dolphin: I didn't know if you invited him here just because you wanted
00:06 - Michael Kianmahd: to.
00:07 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah, this is not the share time.
00:08 - Michael Kianmahd: This is just the Maxim Faye
00:10 - Laura Dolphin: call.
00:10 - Laura Dolphin: Okay, okay, yeah.
00:12 - Laura Dolphin: You just rescheduled because you had some things that you wanted
to go through from the Monday call, and sorry I couldn't make that.
00:19 - Laura Dolphin: It was chaos around here.
00:25 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah, so let me just pull something up.
00:28 - Michael Kianmahd: I
00:28 - Laura Dolphin: mean you
00:28 - Michael Kianmahd: guys you guys still have that scheduled for tomorrow is that right
00:36 - Laura Dolphin: I don't have like hours.
00:37 - Laura Dolphin: I have the Kinfei Maxim.
00:41 - Laura Dolphin: So, yeah, we can we can keep that one.
00:44 - Laura Dolphin: I am trying to schedule with Carlos time with Martin because I'm
ready for the pricing tool now.
00:50 - Laura Dolphin: that we've got the integration going with Alejandro.
00:54 - Laura Dolphin: But yeah, I don't know.
00:55 - Laura Dolphin: Maybe we'll just use that time to talk about
00:57 - Michael Kianmahd: it.
00:58 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah, I think you should take that time just to make sure like the
Notion dates are updated.
01:02 - Michael Kianmahd: I think there was some stuff that was.
01:04 - Michael Kianmahd: Fae dependent or Fae
01:05 - Laura Dolphin: influence.
01:06 - Michael Kianmahd: Okay.
01:07 - Michael Kianmahd: That needs to be stated.
01:08 - Michael Kianmahd: And I think like just
01:10 - Michael Kianmahd: kind of updating time tracking.
01:12 - Laura Dolphin: Sure.
01:13 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah,
01:13 - Michael Kianmahd: absolutely.
01:14 - Michael Kianmahd: Helpful to
01:14 - Laura Dolphin: us.
01:15 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
01:15 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
01:15 - Laura Dolphin: Carlos, Martin and Christian are all on that call.
01:18 - Laura Dolphin: So I feel like between the three of us, we
01:19 - Michael Kianmahd: can
01:21 - Laura Dolphin: use that time and knock that out.
01:23 - Laura Dolphin: I will start want to start slotting in some launch dates for all this stuff
as well.
01:31 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah,
01:31 - Michael Kianmahd: for sure.
01:32 - Michael Kianmahd: Okay.
01:33 - Michael Kianmahd: And then I'm not going to be on tomorrow's call.
01:35 - Michael Kianmahd: So Lynn, if you could.
01:36 - Michael Kianmahd: uh
01:38 - Laura Dolphin: actually he's already
01:39 - Michael Kianmahd: on it okay that's actually lynn that's your time with um
01:44 - Michael Kianmahd: With
01:44 - Lyndon Elam: Dawn.
01:45 - Lyndon Elam: Yeah.
01:45 - Lyndon Elam: Yeah, it just gets overlapped.
01:48 - Michael Kianmahd: Can we push it up 30 minutes, Laura?
01:51 - Laura Dolphin: I'll check with Carlos and Martin and Christian.
01:59 - Laura Dolphin: Lynn, I can see your calendar.
02:01 - Laura Dolphin: So as long as everything's in there,
02:03 - Lyndon Elam: I can work with
02:03 - Laura Dolphin: them to make sure that we find the time.
02:06 - Laura Dolphin: Does that work?
02:07 - Lyndon Elam: It's update.
02:08 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
02:09 - Laura Dolphin: All right.
02:11 - Laura Dolphin: Okay, beyond that, I don't really like.
02:14 - Laura Dolphin: Probably timelines are the only thing that I had for us because we did
all of the stuff on the steering committee.
02:22 - Laura Dolphin: So I don't know, Lynn, if you want to use this time to work with me on
visibility into anything or if you had any questions, anything that you wanted to go through.
02:31 - Laura Dolphin: I don't really have anything for us today.
02:33 - Laura Dolphin: I thought we were talking about timelines.
02:36 - Lyndon Elam: I think that'd be helpful.
02:37 - Lyndon Elam: I think going through near term, Laura, here's what you're focused on.
02:42 - Lyndon Elam: Maybe here's what you're waiting on.
02:47 - Lyndon Elam: Any blockers, any obstacles on our end that we should be focused on
removing to help you be as productive as possible?
02:55 - Laura Dolphin: Okay, I don't actually have any blockers on you guys
02:58 - Lyndon Elam: right now.
02:58 - Laura Dolphin: That's good news.
03:00 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah, I will.
03:02 - Laura Dolphin: That'll be coming.
03:04 - Laura Dolphin: But right now my blockers are Kin with the pricing tool, but Carlos,
he's aware of that.
03:12 - Lyndon Elam: So I'm trying to
03:12 - Laura Dolphin: get to
03:13 - Lyndon Elam: them.
03:14 - Lyndon Elam: If it's a kin blocker, it is a blocker on our
03:16 - Laura Dolphin: end.
03:17 - Laura Dolphin: So
03:18 - Lyndon Elam: we should use our leverage to remove that.
03:21 - Laura Dolphin: So let's talk about.
03:23 - Laura Dolphin: That's a kit.
03:24 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
03:24 - Laura Dolphin: So basically the scoring integration, I mentioned this on Monday.
03:30 - Laura Dolphin: Also, Michael, I don't know if you want to see that, but I did demon-
strate it after you dropped off with like the new scoring models.
03:36 - Laura Dolphin: It's not all that exciting because all it's really doing in addition to like
what it does today is it brings back those scoring and it applies all the data model changes.
03:45 - Laura Dolphin: But that is ready to go.
03:50 - Michael Kianmahd: I said
03:50 - Laura Dolphin: great.
03:51 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
03:51 - Laura Dolphin: So that's ready to go.
03:53 - Laura Dolphin: We'll still do like some further testing because I'm sure there'll be
some like variables that need updating and stuff.
03:58 - Laura Dolphin: But we have all of the new data model changes.
04:01 - Laura Dolphin: It's scoring.
04:02 - Laura Dolphin: It's returning all this stuff.
04:03 - Laura Dolphin: So that's exciting.
04:05 - Laura Dolphin: So I poked the team.
04:07 - Laura Dolphin: um a couple days ago yeah on monday and just said like hey guys
we're now ready for the pricing tool um so he's trying to coordinate time with martin um
now to make sure that that's connected and that we can like that's working and it has all the
changes um so i just poked him again this morning um because he just said he's trying to
coordinate time with martin um so that they can do that and i haven't heard back from him
yet so
04:31 - Laura Dolphin: I'm pushing that one along.
04:34 - Laura Dolphin: Obviously, if you guys have calls scheduled with them today, please
do mention that.
04:40 - Laura Dolphin: That is one of the remaining
04:41 - Lyndon Elam: hurdles.
04:42 - Lyndon Elam: So Laura, can you just?
04:46 - Lyndon Elam: articulate again, what is it that you need from them?
04:51 - Laura Dolphin: Sandbox connection to the pricing tool.
04:57 - Laura Dolphin: for testing updates and validation of
05:03 - Laura Dolphin: integration with data model changes.
05:10 - Lyndon Elam: Okay.
05:10 - Lyndon Elam: And I love how you said it slower.
05:13 - Laura Dolphin: Well, I try because I talk
05:14 - Lyndon Elam: really
05:15 - Laura Dolphin: fast normally.
05:18 - Laura Dolphin: And solo parenting week, I always double the coffee.
05:20 - Laura Dolphin: So it's just like that.
05:21 - Laura Dolphin: But yeah.
05:23 - Laura Dolphin: I'll have AI send you a.
05:26 - Lyndon Elam: No, that's good.
05:28 - Lyndon Elam: I appreciated that.
05:29 - Laura Dolphin: Okay.
05:29 - Laura Dolphin: Got it.
05:30 - Laura Dolphin: Carlos just responded to me as well.
05:32 - Laura Dolphin: So he said they're just doing, I'm currently implementing adjustments
to the pricing tool, something about Randall Riley API.
05:39 - Laura Dolphin: There was an issue.
05:41 - Laura Dolphin: blah, blah, blah this week.
05:43 - Laura Dolphin: So we propose holding it next Tuesday.
05:48 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah, okay.
05:52 - Laura Dolphin: I'll respond and I'll let you know if there is any escalation
05:56 - Lyndon Elam: that I
05:56 - Laura Dolphin: think.
05:56 - Laura Dolphin: So
05:58 - Lyndon Elam: if you're saying, yeah, if you're saying this is a blocker, then what I'm
hearing you saying is we can't move forward on this until this is resolved.
06:06 - Lyndon Elam: which, waiting until next Tuesday, does not feel good to
06:10 - Laura Dolphin: me.
06:11 - Laura Dolphin: it
06:13 - Laura Dolphin: I don't.
06:13 - Laura Dolphin: So here's the thing is that it's the pricing.
06:17 - Laura Dolphin: It could be a non-issue or it could be a big issue.
06:20 - Laura Dolphin: I just don't know until it actually gets connected and
06:22 - Lyndon Elam: tested.
06:24 - Laura Dolphin: Do you know what I mean?
06:24 - Laura Dolphin: Because I don't, I don't know the pricing tool, the way that I know the
scoring integration where I can say, this is going to break.
06:34 - Laura Dolphin: I don't think there's a lot of changes that are needed, but if there's
some and those changes result in it taking like a few weeks time, then it's like I'll raise the
red flag.
06:47 - Laura Dolphin: But I don't know that until it actually gets done.
06:49 - Laura Dolphin: So if we can try and push.
06:51 - Laura Dolphin: That would be great.
06:52 - Laura Dolphin: But it sounds like they're currently working on the Randall Riley API
issue that it's impacting your credit team operations.
06:58 - Laura Dolphin: So my guess would be that your production issues are higher priority
07:01 - Lyndon Elam: anyways.
07:02 - Lyndon Elam: Okay.
07:05 - Lyndon Elam: Perhaps.
07:06 - Lyndon Elam: I'm not familiar with the Randall Riley issue.
07:08 - Lyndon Elam: So,
07:08 - Laura Dolphin: Michael, you probably understand.
07:11 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah.
07:11 - Michael Kianmahd: So Randall Riley is a data source.
07:14 - Michael Kianmahd: that we use to get sort of equipment values and...
07:20 - Michael Kianmahd: residual values over time.
07:23 - Michael Kianmahd: It's basically feeding the pricing tool.
07:26 - Michael Kianmahd: Out of nowhere, they basically removed our ability to
07:31 - Michael Kianmahd: to that's right yeah to code it as core condition
07:36 - Michael Kianmahd: So we had a couple conversations with us and they basically
suggested that we hard code a discount.
07:44 - Michael Kianmahd: On kind of on good condition assets, so there's like good fair poor
07:49 - Michael Kianmahd: Everything was kind of hinged on what the poor outcome was
because when we pick up an asset, it's typically in poor condition.
07:55 - Michael Kianmahd: So it did a better job estimating based on historical outcomes.
08:00 - Michael Kianmahd: So Ken and their team, as of this morning, sent an update that
the changes have been made.
08:06 - Michael Kianmahd: and it's available for us to test.
08:09 - Michael Kianmahd: Lynn, did you see that come through?
08:12 - Lyndon Elam: I have not caught up to that one yet.
08:14 - Michael Kianmahd: Okay, so that I think was...
08:21 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah, that was definitely this morning.
08:23 - Michael Kianmahd: So 6.19 a.m.
08:24 - Lyndon Elam: Okay.
08:29 - Michael Kianmahd: I typically around the team to do that, but you may want to kind
of click into it and just make sure it's working
08:34 - Lyndon Elam: correctly.
08:35 - Lyndon Elam: All right.
08:36 - Lyndon Elam: Hey, so Laura, I'm going to tease out something from earlier in this call.
08:43 - Lyndon Elam: Kin is us.
08:46 - Lyndon Elam: Just like Faye.
08:48 - Lyndon Elam: is
08:49 - Laura Dolphin: us to kin
08:50 - Lyndon Elam: yep so any interaction you're having with
08:54 - Laura Dolphin: them
08:56 - Lyndon Elam: please copy me on
08:57 - Laura Dolphin: that um okay so we use a slack channel it's uh any sort of
09:05 - Laura Dolphin: Okay.
09:05 - Laura Dolphin: Configurator developer's preferred method.
09:09 - Laura Dolphin: I can probably add you.
09:10 - Laura Dolphin: I just, you might need like a user, but yeah.
09:14 - Laura Dolphin: What
09:15 - Lyndon Elam: I do is.
09:16 - Lyndon Elam: I'd say if it's getting to like.
09:19 - Lyndon Elam: You know, if you're passing quick information back and forth, if you're
talking about timelines, timelines are super important to
09:26 - Laura Dolphin: me.
09:27 - Laura Dolphin: Totally.
09:28 - Laura Dolphin: That's why I'm kind of
09:29 - Lyndon Elam: calling it out.
09:29 - Lyndon Elam: Yeah, no, I
09:30 - Laura Dolphin: appreciate it.
09:30 - Laura Dolphin: It's a non-issue at this point.
09:32 - Laura Dolphin: I'm just kind of letting you guys know these are the next steps.
09:36 - Laura Dolphin: I don't think that they'll hold it up because they're normally pretty good.
09:40 - Laura Dolphin: In the past, I have always said to Michael, like, I need you to like.
09:44 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
09:46 - Laura Dolphin: But I'll let them.
09:48 - Laura Dolphin: kind of I'll work with them and I will let you know if I feel like it needs
09:52 - Lyndon Elam: pushing.
09:53 - Laura Dolphin: I'll
09:53 - Lyndon Elam: communicate the same thing to them later this
09:55 - Laura Dolphin: morning.
09:56 - Lyndon Elam: But if you're talking about timelines, I'd like that to be pulled out of Slack
and into an email
10:02 - Laura Dolphin: so that
10:03 - Lyndon Elam: we've got visibility to it.
10:05 - Lyndon Elam: I don't need to be involved in.
10:07 - Laura Dolphin: you know,
10:08 - Lyndon Elam: dimensions of this field need to be such and such, right?
10:11 - Lyndon Elam: That's.
10:12 - Lyndon Elam: Yeah.
10:12 - Lyndon Elam: That's sufficiently in the weeds that I don't need to be there, but.
10:16 - Lyndon Elam: Timeline, scope creep, that kind of stuff.
10:18 - Lyndon Elam: That's all super important for us to have line
10:21 - Laura Dolphin: of sight on.
10:22 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah, absolutely.
10:22 - Laura Dolphin: Well, we can also, I will raise it in our call tomorrow.
10:26 - Laura Dolphin: Carlos and Martin will both be on that for sure.
10:29 - Lyndon Elam: Perfect.
10:30 - Laura Dolphin: Cool.
10:32 - Laura Dolphin: Okay.
10:32 - Laura Dolphin: Sorry.
10:33 - Laura Dolphin: I forget where we were before that.
10:35 - Michael Kianmahd: Laura, I think where we left off last week also, you were going to
update the...
10:41 - Michael Kianmahd: What's it called?
10:42 - Michael Kianmahd: The GitHub thing?
10:43 - Laura Dolphin: Yes.
10:45 - Laura Dolphin: I apologize.
10:45 - Laura Dolphin: I haven't had time to do that today.
10:47 - Laura Dolphin: I will do that and I can have that ready for tomorrow.
10:49 - Laura Dolphin: My computer has, I'm having some computer issues with support this
week and transitioning.
10:55 - Laura Dolphin: I will have that ready for, I can either have that ready for later today
or I'll have that ready for tomorrow.
11:00 - Michael Kianmahd: You want to do like a...
11:03 - Michael Kianmahd: you know, like a 30 minute, 15 minute kind of overview for Lynn
on Friday.
11:08 - Michael Kianmahd: I think we're both pretty open on Friday.
11:11 - Laura Dolphin: I prefer not to do Friday.
11:12 - Laura Dolphin: I've got some deployments that I need to do, but I'm pretty open
tomorrow and can have it ready for the KINFAMAC sometime or extend that by an hour or
15 minutes, I think.
11:24 - Michael Kianmahd: Lynn, do you want to set time
11:25 - Lyndon Elam: for that for tomorrow?
11:26 - Lyndon Elam: Sure.
11:28 - Laura Dolphin: I can do that.
11:28 - Laura Dolphin: I'll look in your calendar when I move the meeting.
11:31 - Laura Dolphin: Oh, I have to work with Carlos to see when they're available.
11:34 - Laura Dolphin: I will find time and I'll get that all coordinated if that
11:37 - Lyndon Elam: works.
11:38 - Lyndon Elam: Yeah, my calendar's up to date other than shifting the EA.
11:41 - Lyndon Elam: Okay.
11:42 - Lyndon Elam: In fei maximum, medium to 930 Pacific time tomorrow
11:47 - Laura Dolphin: morning.
11:48 - Laura Dolphin: Sounds good.
11:49 - Lyndon Elam: Okay.
11:52 - Laura Dolphin: um okay so sorry i'm trying to remember before we're talking about
um oh yeah sorry so the next um just in terms of like next steps so pricing tool um we're
finishing up the conga docs this week
12:10 - Laura Dolphin: I've just refreshed the full copy.
12:11 - Laura Dolphin: So we're moving into like kind of, I'm prepping and gearing up for.
12:17 - Laura Dolphin: getting the users to start user acceptance testing sort of end of this
week, early next week.
12:24 - Laura Dolphin: So I've been working on like documentation, all that kind of stuff.
12:29 - Laura Dolphin: updating the validation rules.
12:30 - Laura Dolphin: I've got to catch myself up.
12:32 - Laura Dolphin: I saw some tickets that were completed this morning.
12:36 - Laura Dolphin: But yeah, we're moving into like the UAT phase, which is exciting.
12:42 - Michael Kianmahd: For the data model?
12:44 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah.
12:45 - Laura Dolphin: Okay.
12:46 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah.
12:46 - Laura Dolphin: That's good.
12:47 - Laura Dolphin: For all of that.
12:48 - Laura Dolphin: There's a lot of pieces to that puzzle,
12:50 - Michael Kianmahd: but yeah.
12:51 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah.
12:52 - Michael Kianmahd: And then Laura, on the docs, are you moving forward with the
TR doc mapping for Conga
12:57 - Laura Dolphin: for now?
12:59 - Michael Kianmahd: Yes.
12:59 - Laura Dolphin: Awesome.
13:00 - Michael Kianmahd: And when something to flag, like when you think is the right time,
something I kind of want your hands on.
13:08 - Laura Dolphin: Moving over to like
13:09 - Michael Kianmahd: the new
13:09 - Laura Dolphin: docs.
13:10 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
13:11 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
13:12 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
13:12 - Laura Dolphin: That's I feel like let's get this up and
13:15 - Michael Kianmahd: running
13:16 - Laura Dolphin: and then that'll be the right
13:17 - Michael Kianmahd: time
13:18 - Laura Dolphin: as part of that activity as well.
13:21 - Laura Dolphin: The way that we're going about it is we're taking a lot of the docs that
are similar.
13:26 - Laura Dolphin: and then putting in like little if statements in them to try and overall
simplify the documents as well.
13:33 - Laura Dolphin: So you have a lot of like versions of the same document where one
will just show a different like.
13:39 - Laura Dolphin: title or a different word based off of if they're like a title loan versus
not or like California versus Arkansas or whatever it is.
13:47 - Laura Dolphin: So we're trying to overall simplify it, which will make it'll be like a good
pathway to when you get to trying to make the changes, you'll have less overall documents
to change.
13:57 - Laura Dolphin: That makes
13:58 - Michael Kianmahd: sense.
13:59 - Laura Dolphin: Yep.
14:00 - Laura Dolphin: Yep.
14:01 - Laura Dolphin: Okay.
14:04 - Laura Dolphin: great i don't have anything else so lynn did you want to go through
anything else
14:10 - Laura Dolphin: Specifically, do you want to actually dive into the org at all?
14:15 - Lyndon Elam: Yeah, if we've got time, let's do that.
14:19 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
14:19 - Laura Dolphin: Do you want to look at production or did you have questions from like
for the data model?
14:26 - Lyndon Elam: So,
14:27 - Laura Dolphin: um, I could spend, I could spend like all day just jumping in the work
and what would you like to actually like discuss and
14:34 - Lyndon Elam: see?
14:35 - Lyndon Elam: So there were some recent changes made to the org, correct?
14:41 - Laura Dolphin: Are you talking about production, like the vendor number?
14:45 - Lyndon Elam: I thought I recall on a...
14:47 - Lyndon Elam: call last
14:49 - Laura Dolphin: week
14:50 - Lyndon Elam: or Monday.
14:50 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah, sorry,
14:51 - Lyndon Elam: the days are kind of blending together.
14:53 - Lyndon Elam: that you had mentioned that there were some changes that had been
made.
14:59 - Laura Dolphin: Yes, we did too.
15:01 - Laura Dolphin: Oh, gosh.
15:08 - Laura Dolphin: Does that work?
15:09 - Laura Dolphin: No.
15:11 - Laura Dolphin: I just switched to Zoom.
15:18 - Lyndon Elam: Sharing?
15:18 - Lyndon Elam: Is that
15:19 - Laura Dolphin: what you said?
15:19 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah, there's something on my computer that doesn't allow me to
share my screen when I'm on a Google Meet.
15:26 - Lyndon Elam: What are you pulling up?
15:27 - Laura Dolphin: Are you pulling up the ear?
15:29 - Laura Dolphin: It just like the share button just does nothing on my...
15:32 - Laura Dolphin: on the Google Meet.
15:33 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah, that's hence the issue.
15:35 - Laura Dolphin: It's like, doesn't matter how many times I click it, it doesn't.
15:38 - Laura Dolphin: So, yeah, so the two changes that were made in production this week,
number one was the MHC.
15:44 - Laura Dolphin: the um like validation for the dealer incentive if the dealer is an mhc
dealer
15:53 - Laura Dolphin: So the previous rule was, well, part of it was it needed updating just
based on like another recent change.
16:01 - Laura Dolphin: And then the other thing is Jay actually changed the rules where
previously it was just saying you need 5%, a minimum 5%.
16:09 - Laura Dolphin: Now what it does is if the tier is one and two, it needs 8%.
16:13 - Laura Dolphin: And if the tier is three, four and five, it needs 5%.
16:16 - Laura Dolphin: So I put that live yesterday and Jay said it was good to go.
16:20 - Laura Dolphin: And then the other one is there was the vendor number.
16:26 - Laura Dolphin: which is a vendor is the same thing as a dealer from all intents of
sales, Salesforce purposes.
16:33 - Laura Dolphin: When a dealer gets created, there used to be an automation that
assigns it like a unique vendor number, dealer number that is needed for Leaseworks.
16:45 - Laura Dolphin: We were going to stop using that and just use a tax ID, but we need
that unique identifier for Leaseworks.
16:51 - Laura Dolphin: So we put that automation back.
16:53 - Laura Dolphin: And that was also put back yesterday.
16:56 - Lyndon Elam: As I'm looking at the future, the new future ERD data model,
17:03 - Lyndon Elam: We don't appear to have an object for the vendor.
17:10 - Lyndon Elam: Am I, is that right?
17:11 - Laura Dolphin: It's, it's an account.
17:13 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
17:13 - Laura Dolphin: They're all accounts.
17:15 - Laura Dolphin: So customers and vendors and brokers, they're all accounts.
17:20 - Lyndon Elam: Okay.
17:21 - Lyndon Elam: And so how do we differentiate just, is it the record type that differen-
tiates the.
17:27 - Lyndon Elam: the type of account
17:29 - Laura Dolphin: yeah good question so today we just use a type field
17:33 - Laura Dolphin: On the account record, which is sort of messy because there's
different types of like your dealers and then there's technically different types of brokers and
there's different types of customers.
17:46 - Laura Dolphin: So today it's just differentiated in that field.
17:49 - Laura Dolphin: part of the data model change is we are actually shifting to using
record types.
17:55 - Laura Dolphin: Are you familiar with record types in Salesforce and what they do and
why to use them?
18:00 - Lyndon Elam: Maybe not.
18:01 - Laura Dolphin: So let's.
18:02 - Laura Dolphin: Okay.
18:03 - Laura Dolphin: So what a record type does is it segments the different like classifi-
cations of different records.
18:09 - Laura Dolphin: So for example.
18:11 - Laura Dolphin: because we're using accounts to hold both customers and then
partners.
18:17 - Laura Dolphin: A record type, having them in different record types allows you to do
things like display different fields on your
18:23 - Lyndon Elam: layouts,
18:24 - Laura Dolphin: have different drop down, right?
18:25 - Laura Dolphin: So you can have a single status field, but your customers might have
like active, inactive versus your partners might have like gold, silver, bronze, right?
18:34 - Laura Dolphin: And you can have one single field to represent that.
18:36 - Laura Dolphin: So that's what record types do.
18:38 - Laura Dolphin: This data model is introducing record types on accounts, contacts,
collateral, which is vehicles.
18:46 - Laura Dolphin: and then changing them on opportunities to suit the way that we
actually do business.
18:51 - Lyndon Elam: It's big.
18:52 - Lyndon Elam: That's a big change.
18:54 - Lyndon Elam: Okay.
18:55 - Lyndon Elam: And how much history do we currently, I mean, do we have everything
going back in time in our?
19:02 - Lyndon Elam: org or how how far back
19:05 - Laura Dolphin: does it go um so michael correct me if i'm wrong i think the org is
from like 2015 or something like that is it 2015
19:12 - Michael Kianmahd: 2014 i think our original salesforce
19:17 - Michael Kianmahd: purchase was probably like 2011
19:21 - Michael Kianmahd: Maybe something like that.
19:23 - Michael Kianmahd: It predated me.
19:26 - Michael Kianmahd: And then I think where the fork in the road occurred.
19:29 - Michael Kianmahd: to an opportunity record was probably 11 or 12.
19:34 - Michael Kianmahd: around the time we got the Wells Fargo facility to finance the
trucking side of the business.
19:39 - Michael Kianmahd: And I think that, and then I think the wedge just kind of kept
growing from that point in time.
19:44 - Lyndon Elam: So we have historical data going in the org going back to
19:48 - Michael Kianmahd: 2011,
19:50 - Laura Dolphin: 2012?
19:52 - Lyndon Elam: Something like that, yeah.
19:53 - Lyndon Elam: Laura, what...
19:55 - Michael Kianmahd: One thing
19:55 - Lyndon Elam: about that.
19:56 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah.
19:57 - Michael Kianmahd: The inputs, like the...
20:01 - Michael Kianmahd: the data entered is not consistent.
20:03 - Michael Kianmahd: There's probably like a lot less rich data.
20:06 - Michael Kianmahd: and a lot less consistently data entered in the earlier years versus
the more recent years.
20:12 - Michael Kianmahd: because we've been adding
20:13 - Laura Dolphin: fields
20:13 - Michael Kianmahd: and we've just like other things matter and that kind of
20:16 - Lyndon Elam: thing.
20:16 - Lyndon Elam: So
20:17 - Michael Kianmahd: I don't expect a complete set.
20:18 - Michael Kianmahd: The other nuance is.
20:20 - Michael Kianmahd: I mentioned this, you know, kind of in passing last year, but when
we built the BL model.
20:26 - Michael Kianmahd: The data that we would have typically for a credit report on a TR
opportunity record did not exist for BL until about a year ago.
20:35 - Michael Kianmahd: So we're a little behind in April on that
20:37 - Lyndon Elam: database.
20:38 - Lyndon Elam: Okay.
20:40 - Lyndon Elam: How much runway do we have, Laura, until we...
20:44 - Lyndon Elam: We are pushing up against our...
20:48 - Lyndon Elam: data capacity.
20:49 - Lyndon Elam: We don't have that many opportunities.
20:51 - Lyndon Elam: We don't have that many accounts.
20:53 - Lyndon Elam: But I think we've probably got a more complex org than most other
instances.
20:59 - Lyndon Elam: So...
21:01 - Laura Dolphin: So in terms of storage, you're at 81% for data.
21:06 - Laura Dolphin: That's your like object storage.
21:07 - Laura Dolphin: And then we're at.
21:10 - Laura Dolphin: 352% for your file storage.
21:14 - Laura Dolphin: I'm Michael.
21:16 - Laura Dolphin: This has changed.
21:22 - Laura Dolphin: Michael.
21:25 - Laura Dolphin: Yes.
21:26 - Laura Dolphin: The account manager.
21:28 - Michael Kianmahd: Oh, you're asking our new account manager's
21:30 - Laura Dolphin: name?
21:31 - Laura Dolphin: No.
21:33 - Laura Dolphin: Where did that conversation get to with the one terabyte?
21:36 - Laura Dolphin: Because it's gone back in your 352% of
21:41 - Michael Kianmahd: file storage.
21:43 - Laura Dolphin: Oh.
21:43 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah.
21:43 - Michael Kianmahd: So they're ridiculous.
21:45 - Michael Kianmahd: So
21:45 - Laura Dolphin: I'll just.
21:46 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
21:46 - Laura Dolphin: Sorry, Lynn.
21:48 - Laura Dolphin: There's like.
21:48 - Laura Dolphin: So basically you're over, but Michael worked with his account renewal
manager at some point to get one terabyte of storage so that it's not supposed to be 352%.
22:04 - Laura Dolphin: So I don't actually have the right amount.
22:07 - Laura Dolphin: But that's just file storage.
22:09 - Laura Dolphin: So that's not data storage.
22:11 - Laura Dolphin: Data storage, you are at 81%, unless there was a limit that went down
on that one too.
22:20 - Laura Dolphin: I'll have to find an old screenshot of what that used to be.
22:24 - Laura Dolphin: But you do have a lot of data.
22:26 - Laura Dolphin: So you have
22:28 - Laura Dolphin: The majority, 26%, and then following 18% of that data storage are
the credit.
22:37 - Laura Dolphin: the credit scoring data that gets populated for every credit report that
you run.
22:42 - Laura Dolphin: personal credit reports.
22:44 - Laura Dolphin: I should say not like when you're scoring a deal.
22:46 - Laura Dolphin: we store a very high volume of data.
22:51 - Laura Dolphin: records, things like that.
22:53 - Laura Dolphin: I have called this out before with Michael and the team.
22:57 - Laura Dolphin: And the consensus of that is that they want to keep that data.
22:59 - Laura Dolphin: There's no like if it's older than 10 years, get rid of it.
23:03 - Laura Dolphin: I'd probably recommend at some point revisiting that conversation
because if you don't
23:09 - Laura Dolphin: it's going to just keep getting higher and then you'll have to either
purchase more data or work.
23:13 - Laura Dolphin: to try and get a deal.
23:14 - Lyndon Elam: But yeah.
23:14 - Lyndon Elam: From a regulatory standpoint.
23:17 - Lyndon Elam: I know we are under different guidelines as a...
23:21 - Lyndon Elam: commercial business than a retail business.
23:23 - Laura Dolphin: But
23:26 - Lyndon Elam: I would guess that we aren't permitted to store bureaus any more than
seven years at the most.
23:33 - Lyndon Elam: I don't know if that's, and I know we've had those rules in place in retail
businesses.
23:43 - Lyndon Elam: We may want to look at that.
23:44 - Lyndon Elam: That may free up some.
23:47 - Lyndon Elam: data storage going forward.
23:52 - Lyndon Elam: Michael, do we have external compliance that we can check in on that?
23:56 - Lyndon Elam: Or would you like me to...
23:58 - Lyndon Elam: track down someone who could serve in that role.
24:03 - Michael Kianmahd: I'm aware of, I mean, there's like an industry group that covers
that.
24:09 - Michael Kianmahd: There's nobody we work with that I thought was exceptional.
24:15 - Michael Kianmahd: and sort of regulatory risk.
24:18 - Michael Kianmahd: has shifted over time in our
24:19 - Lyndon Elam: space.
24:21 - Michael Kianmahd: Let's add that to our agenda of things to discuss and kind of
strategize around and have some thoughts on that.
24:29 - Lyndon Elam: Okay.
24:32 - Michael Kianmahd: What was the nuance on that?
24:33 - Michael Kianmahd: It was about storing credit bureaus, like what's the risk there?
24:41 - Lyndon Elam: It's such highly sensitive information.
24:43 - Lyndon Elam: And even the bureaus don't.
24:46 - Lyndon Elam: go back that far.
24:48 - Lyndon Elam: I mean, I think beyond seven years, the bureaus start to archive data.
24:54 - Lyndon Elam: And so if I was a regulatory body, I would say if the bureaus are doing
that, why do you all need to retain?
25:01 - Lyndon Elam: That information, particularly synth and asset, only lasts up to five
years on our books.
25:09 - Lyndon Elam: Maybe five and a half.
25:12 - Michael Kianmahd: I mean, you have to keep your tax records for 10 years.
25:15 - Michael Kianmahd: Is that right?
25:19 - Lyndon Elam: I'm not sure what it is for taxes.
25:25 - Lyndon Elam: For PII, it's pretty sensitive
25:27 - Michael Kianmahd: stuff.
25:29 - Lyndon Elam: But yeah, in this landscape, it may not be as sensitive.
25:35 - Laura Dolphin: Okay.
25:37 - Lyndon Elam: I know we're about out of time.
25:38 - Lyndon Elam: One last question,
25:39 - Laura Dolphin: Laura.
25:40 - Lyndon Elam: Hierarchy for vendors slash dealers.
25:46 - Lyndon Elam: So if we have a dealer group, is that embedded in here?
25:51 - Laura Dolphin: Ah, good question.
25:52 - Laura Dolphin: Part of the data model change.
25:53 - Laura Dolphin: We are not
25:54 - Lyndon Elam: using...
25:55 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah, we're not using those, but that's part of the data model change
as
25:58 - Lyndon Elam: well.
25:59 - Lyndon Elam: That will be
25:59 - Laura Dolphin: coming.
26:03 - Lyndon Elam: same thing with customer
26:05 - Laura Dolphin: records
26:07 - Lyndon Elam: we'll have parent child
26:11 - Laura Dolphin: And we're going to be using one contact to multiple accounts to try
and reduce the duplicates that are being generated.
26:18 - Laura Dolphin: Basically, this is what like caused this whole project was they were
like they were giving me these examples being like, this isn't working, this doesn't look right.
26:26 - Laura Dolphin: And I'm looking and they're creating contacts as accounts and vice
versa in order to like get around hurdles in the way that the org is structured and stuff.
26:34 - Laura Dolphin: So I was like, well, hang on a second.
26:35 - Laura Dolphin: So, yeah, we're going to be using like proper hierarchies and things
like that.
26:39 - Laura Dolphin: cleaning all of that up.
26:40 - Laura Dolphin: So it's quite a big thing, but
26:43 - Lyndon Elam: yep.
26:43 - Laura Dolphin: Okay.
26:43 - Laura Dolphin: Doing it all the right way.
26:45 - Lyndon Elam: Okay.
26:45 - Lyndon Elam: All right.
26:46 - Lyndon Elam: I think that's it for
26:47 - Laura Dolphin: now.
26:47 - Laura Dolphin: Thank you.
26:48 - Laura Dolphin: Awesome.
26:48 - Laura Dolphin: Okay.
26:49 - Laura Dolphin: I will reschedule tomorrow.
26:52 - Laura Dolphin: schedule some time with you to go through the portfolio.
26:54 - Laura Dolphin: And if you have any other questions, feel free to kind of store them
and happy to go through them tomorrow.
27:00 - Michael Kianmahd: Thank you.
27:01 - Laura Dolphin: Thanks.
27:04 - Michael Kianmahd: Let's meet in the conference room.
27:05 - Michael Kianmahd: Okay.
27:06 - Michael Kianmahd: All right.
27:07 - Michael Kianmahd: Thanks.
