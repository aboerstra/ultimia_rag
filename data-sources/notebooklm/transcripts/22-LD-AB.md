Maxim Roadmap Planning Transcript
00:03 - Laura Dolphin: I'm papering it right now.
00:05 - Adrian Boerstra: Okay, I'm going to just go on mute.
00:08 - Adrian Boerstra: So as soon as you're ready, you just go ahead.
00:11 - Adrian Boerstra: And again, I'll let you just sort of go through and talk things through
out loud.
00:16 - Adrian Boerstra: You just let me know if you want me to chime in with a thought or
opinion.
00:20 - Laura Dolphin: Okay, chime in at your, just chime in when you have questions or
comments that you think will help.
00:26 - Adrian Boerstra: Okay, sounds good.
00:27 - Laura Dolphin: Okay, so I'll start with like the markers or the milestones that we want
to get to.
00:34 - Laura Dolphin: So the first...
00:36 - Adrian Boerstra: You're going to share your screen?
00:37 - Laura Dolphin: Oh, no, I literally have a piece of paper.
00:40 - Adrian Boerstra: Oh, okay.
00:41 - Adrian Boerstra: There is a whiteboard also in Zoom.
00:44 - Adrian Boerstra: Have you ever used it?
00:46 - Laura Dolphin: No.
00:49 - Adrian Boerstra: Go to More, Whiteboards, and then click on New Whiteboard.
00:56 - Laura Dolphin: Okay.
00:58 - Laura Dolphin: Okay, okay.
01:02 - Adrian Boerstra: If this, if you want to use this, go for it.
01:05 - Adrian Boerstra: If you just want to keep on your paper, go for it.
01:08 - Laura Dolphin: I'll start, I'll just type so that we have something to show for it.
01:12 - Laura Dolphin: Um, so I'm going to put the markers on the right hand because that's
the way that makes the most sense to me.
01:16 - Laura Dolphin: Okay.
01:17 - Laura Dolphin: Um, so he wants, a big one that we're working on is the ability on an
opportunity to basically let's pause for one quick second.
01:27 - Adrian Boerstra: Let's just recap what we're doing.
01:29 - Laura Dolphin: Good call.
01:31 - Adrian Boerstra: So yeah, I'll let you go ahead.
01:34 - Laura Dolphin: Okay, so we are whiteboarding to define milestones or markers
01:41 - Laura Dolphin: for Maxim so that we can come up with a roadmap to those markers
and define all of the tasks that
01:50 - Laura Dolphin: are needed to reach those markers and the appropriate amount of
hours allocated to each
01:56 - Laura Dolphin: and which calendar month they can be accomplished within.
02:01 - Laura Dolphin: Does that sum it up?
02:04 - Adrian Boerstra: Perfect.
02:05 - Laura Dolphin: Okay.
02:06 - Laura Dolphin: Okay, so I'll start here on the right hand side with the markers, which
are our goals to get to.
02:14 - Laura Dolphin: So the first one is, I'm going to call it a one-click contract, which is on
an opportunity, basically the ability with one click to produce the relevant data in a document
that can be sent through Docusign to the client for signature for their contract.
02:37 - Laura Dolphin: So the tasks, Actually, do you want me to go through each marker first
or talk about the tasks within?
02:43 - Adrian Boerstra: Go start high level across the board and then get deeper on each
one.
02:47 - Laura Dolphin: Perfect.
02:48 - Laura Dolphin: Okay.
02:49 - Laura Dolphin: So that's one.
02:52 - Laura Dolphin: This is sort of a marker that is, like, it kind of belongs to that, but it is,
could be separate.
02:58 - Laura Dolphin: So I'm just going to put it as separate, but it's the E, so E Notary, which
is a feature in Docusign that they want to make note, make use of, which would come with
the contract, but is a feature that's not currently being used right now.
03:16 - Laura Dolphin: So I've got another one.
03:17 - Laura Dolphin: So number three, I'm going to just call this automated document
management.
03:29 - Laura Dolphin: So this one is the handling of all of the documents within a specific
process and the automated storage of those documents through systems to land in Box,
which is their document storage platform.
03:50 - Laura Dolphin: So in more specific terms, this is taking processes like the funding
checklist, implementing Aio to handle the process, and then funneling that information and
the documents through Salesforce to ultimately land in box with their documents.
04:09 - Laura Dolphin: Does that make sense?
04:10 - Laura Dolphin: Kind of.
04:13 - Adrian Boerstra: Yep.
04:14 - Laura Dolphin: Okay, perfect.
04:16 - Laura Dolphin: The fourth one is scoring models by industry.
04:27 - Laura Dolphin: So this is just improved scoring models from their kin analytics to
score based off of the industry of the account, which is the applicant of the funding deal.
04:39 - Laura Dolphin: The
04:42 - Laura Dolphin: fifth one is.
04:46 - Laura Dolphin: So I'm going to call it.
04:50 - Laura Dolphin: Staff.
04:52 - Laura Dolphin: Accountability.
04:56 - Laura Dolphin: Targets and measurement.
05:01 - Laura Dolphin: So this is just basically putting in place a way where we can actually
individuals, we can report on that and actually track are they doing a good job or not and
make it a little bit more.
05:18 - Laura Dolphin: I guess easier for people to kind of work from home.
05:24 - Laura Dolphin: So the 6th one is we have here.
05:30 - Laura Dolphin: Oh, approval processes.
05:33 - Laura Dolphin: So this kind of fits in with the staff accountability targets and
measurement, but more specifically it relates to the credit approval processes.
05:44 - Laura Dolphin: So this is inputting or putting in place the ability to add an automated
approval process based off of like certain buckets, right?
05:57 - Laura Dolphin: So for example, if the amount of the deal is over a certain amount,
then it automatically goes to like underwriters level one.
06:08 - Laura Dolphin: Ok, and then the last one here is not actually on, was never really one
of Michael's, but it's been one of mine.
06:16 - Laura Dolphin: So marketing and communications.
06:21 - Laura Dolphin: coming up with a better tool and an automated process
06:25 - Laura Dolphin: to take the data that exists in Salesforce
06:28 - Laura Dolphin: and engage both their customer base
06:33 - Laura Dolphin: and their dealer broker network
06:36 - Laura Dolphin: without having to export spreadsheets
06:40 - Laura Dolphin: and upload into a disconnected system
06:43 - Laura Dolphin: as well as not having to hard code Apex
06:48 - Laura Dolphin: to email out of Salesforce.
06:52 - Laura Dolphin: I'll pause there.
06:54 - Laura Dolphin: Adrian, did I miss anything?
06:57 - Adrian Boerstra: No.
07:00 - Laura Dolphin: Okay.
07:02 - Laura Dolphin: Oh, and then.
07:06 - Adrian Boerstra: The only thing that I would just suggest is we're right in on
technology initiatives.
07:12 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
07:12 - Adrian Boerstra: And when we're going through this, I try to tie everything back to a
higher level business goal.
07:21 - Adrian Boerstra: So these are technology level initiatives, but what is the overall
theme?
07:25 - Adrian Boerstra: Are we looking to drive efficiency
07:29 - Adrian Boerstra: you know, like, I just try to make sure that there's like, I would, in our
case, it would be like one level to the right.
07:38 - Adrian Boerstra: Is why are we doing these things?
07:41 - Laura Dolphin: Yep.
07:42 - Laura Dolphin: Okay.
07:42 - Laura Dolphin: So, um, so the first one, the one click contract, the business reason
is efficiency.
07:50 - Laura Dolphin: It's just it's time saving.
07:52 - Laura Dolphin: And it's also layered on with the way that our data is structured.
08:01 - Adrian Boerstra: Well, let's take a minute.
08:01 - Adrian Boerstra: Can we scroll just to the right of your markers?
08:04 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
08:05 - Laura Dolphin: I need to scroll on this bad boy.
08:06 - Adrian Boerstra: I think it's an endless space.
08:09 - Adrian Boerstra: I don't know.
08:09 - Laura Dolphin: I'm going to like.
08:12 - Laura Dolphin: Here we go, hand.
08:14 - Laura Dolphin: There we go.
08:15 - Adrian Boerstra: There we go.
08:16 - Adrian Boerstra: Perfect.
08:17 - Adrian Boerstra: You don't have to tie it.
08:19 - Adrian Boerstra: Don't talk about the initiatives themselves.
08:22 - Adrian Boerstra: just create some like boxes over there on overall what his objectives
are with the business.
08:29 - Adrian Boerstra: And again, this could be increasing efficiency, revenue, lowering
fraud, opening up new revenue channels, market share, those types of things.
08:42 - Adrian Boerstra: Just let's just create some little bubbles over there.
08:45 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah, okay.
08:46 - Laura Dolphin: Why?
08:47 - Adrian Boerstra: And if he has any measurables around that, like, is he trying to
increase revenue by a certain percentage this year?
08:55 - Laura Dolphin: You know what, I don't, well, yes, revenue, but I don't actually know
the details.
09:00 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah, yeah, I mean, you can assume everybody's trying
09:02 - Adrian Boerstra: to increase revenue all the time
09:04 - Adrian Boerstra: but if we can get to specific goals
09:07 - Adrian Boerstra: that he has in the business
09:09 - Adrian Boerstra: that we can start to tie things in
09:11 - Adrian Boerstra: and look at what the actual impact is
09:14 - Adrian Boerstra: of these various things
09:15 - Adrian Boerstra: and we can start to put them in a framework
09:17 - Adrian Boerstra: where we prioritize what's gonna have
09:19 - Adrian Boerstra: biggest impact on his overarching goals.
09:24 - Adrian Boerstra: Okay, so I think about it when we talked about the automated loan
processing, the automated application intake.
09:34 - Adrian Boerstra: He immediately when we asked him what the priority is, his thought
process went to first he was like, well, I've got a team in Columbia on it.
09:42 - Adrian Boerstra: And as of today, they, you know, they're all just waiting for applica-
tions to come in.
09:48 - Adrian Boerstra: We haven't had one come in yet as of noon.
09:52 - Adrian Boerstra: And the moment it comes in, they will process it.
09:54 - Adrian Boerstra: So it's not really hurting the business.
09:57 - Adrian Boerstra: But on the other hand, it would be a big win with the team because
they would be like, yeah, finally, we're getting into the, we're out of the dark ages.
10:05 - Adrian Boerstra: And, you know, this is happening automatically.
10:07 - Adrian Boerstra: And, and wow, that's like, there's a cool factor to just getting that
done.
10:12 - Adrian Boerstra: So he immediately went to thinking about in terms of my overarch-
ing goals, where does that fit in?
10:18 - Adrian Boerstra: So he put everything back into that framework and started thinking
about, well, right now I could really use a win with the team.
10:25 - Adrian Boerstra: So on that basis, it's important, but it's not like the cost savings are
gonna be that huge.
10:31 - Adrian Boerstra: So that's the level at which we wanna start our thinking is what are
the overarching goals that he has that everything ties into.
10:42 - Laura Dolphin: Okay, perfect.
10:44 - Laura Dolphin: I'll give it a go if I get off like back into the brain dump, correct yourself,
whatever.
10:51 - Laura Dolphin: Um, so, okay.
10:55 - Adrian Boerstra: So don't, don't think about the initiatives themselves.
10:58 - Adrian Boerstra: Just imagine you're Michael.
11:00 - Adrian Boerstra: And I asked you the question, what are your goals this year with
your business?
11:03 - Laura Dolphin: Oh, okay.
11:04 - Laura Dolphin: So, um, he wants to like, sort of score better.
11:11 - Laura Dolphin: Basically, it reduces the risk of funding deals that go sour.
11:16 - Laura Dolphin: So I don't know.
11:17 - Adrian Boerstra: So one goal is to increase revenue.
11:22 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
11:25 - Adrian Boerstra: And then off of increasing revenue, one of the things that he wants
to do is increase revenue by increasing the approval rates.
11:37 - Adrian Boerstra: Is that right?
11:38 - Adrian Boerstra: I think, uh, step falling based on what you were just saying.
11:42 - Adrian Boerstra: The scoring, yeah, so more accurate scoring.
11:47 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah, yeah, more accurate scoring would actually lead to reduced.
11:54 - Laura Dolphin: It's yeah, it so increased revenue by more accurate scoring, which
helps.
12:01 - Laura Dolphin: Reduce funding deals that go sour.
12:07 - Laura Dolphin: Like, to put it.
12:09 - Adrian Boerstra: So, losses due to bad deals.
12:10 - Laura Dolphin: Exactly.
12:11 - Laura Dolphin: Yep.
12:11 - Laura Dolphin: Okay.
12:12 - Adrian Boerstra: So that's actually, that's actually reducing losses.
12:16 - Laura Dolphin: Yes.
12:18 - Adrian Boerstra: Which might fall under a different category than increase.
12:21 - Adrian Boerstra: I mean, that actually does increase net revenue, but yeah.
12:25 - Laura Dolphin: Okay.
12:25 - Laura Dolphin: So reduce.
12:26 - Laura Dolphin: Just reduce.
12:28 - Laura Dolphin: Business loss.
12:30 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
12:36 - Adrian Boerstra: I guess, wouldn't it?
12:37 - Laura Dolphin: They call those not delinquencies.
12:42 - Laura Dolphin: Shoot, what is it?
12:44 - Laura Dolphin: Defaults?
12:46 - Laura Dolphin: So default, what do they call it?
12:48 - Laura Dolphin: Shoot, my mind is going blank.
12:50 - Laura Dolphin: Collections, repos, repos.
12:52 - Adrian Boerstra: Ok.
12:53 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
12:55 - Laura Dolphin: Reduce loss in repos due to non-payment.
13:01 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
13:02 - Laura Dolphin: Ok.
13:03 - Laura Dolphin: So, yep, that's one.
13:10 - Laura Dolphin: So the, like, bonuses, basically, like having an actual employee
incentives.
13:23 - Laura Dolphin: So that's where this comes from.
13:25 - Laura Dolphin: It's like for a lot of their employees, they don't actually have a way to
measure if they're doing well or not, so they can't.
13:33 - Adrian Boerstra: Why would he care about employees incentives?
13:36 - Laura Dolphin: So that he can like retain employees.
13:38 - Adrian Boerstra: Okay, so employee retention.
13:41 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
13:42 - Adrian Boerstra: Employee retention is going to probably fall under, that's probably
decreasing losses as well because there's a lot of costs involved with employee turnovers.
13:55 - Adrian Boerstra: So if he wants to retain employees, then he doesn't want to start all
over every time.
14:00 - Adrian Boerstra: That's motivated by probably reducing losses and increasing
efficiency.
14:15 - Laura Dolphin: So that's what that one is.
14:17 - Adrian Boerstra: Okay.
14:18 - Laura Dolphin: And also being able to put the data in that you can report to know if
like- Yeah, maybe throw that one under your increasing efficiency up at the top.
14:30 - Laura Dolphin: Okay.
14:31 - Laura Dolphin: And then, sorry, lost my thought.
14:35 - Laura Dolphin: Okay, so measuring.
14:37 - Laura Dolphin: So, like, actually getting the data out that will help identify trends and
kind of like ahas about funding future deals.
14:50 - Laura Dolphin: I don't know how to.
14:51 - Adrian Boerstra: Is that about finding new opportunities or is that?
14:54 - Laura Dolphin: More so the other way.
14:56 - Laura Dolphin: It's kind of similar to this one where it's like.
15:00 - Adrian Boerstra: This is like getting predictive about like what's going to go bad.
15:07 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah, so I'll give you an example.
15:08 - Laura Dolphin: Maybe it will help.
15:09 - Laura Dolphin: So if the automated scoring comes back, but we find that the scoring
is saying it's a D, yet the user still continues to fund it, and then those are going sour or
something like that.
15:25 - Laura Dolphin: We can identify that of those accounts, most of them are in this
industry, something like that, that allows us to improve the accuracy.
15:35 - Adrian Boerstra: That all still falls under then just reducing losses and reducing loss
in repos.
15:42 - Laura Dolphin: Okay yeah.
15:43 - Adrian Boerstra: Reducing bad deals.
15:45 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah okay.
15:46 - Adrian Boerstra: So what's another, what another, like another goal might have to do
with being able to grow without growing your staff.
15:57 - Adrian Boerstra: So like, yeah, that has to do with efficiency as well, but.
16:02 - Adrian Boerstra: I don't know what I meant by this.
16:03 - Adrian Boerstra: Like we'd like, we want to double our volume, but I don't want to
double my staffing.
16:07 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah, so with the automated application intake one, basically it's like
he's paying for three people to do that, whereas if we just automate it, then he doesn't need
to spend that overhead.
16:20 - Laura Dolphin: So I don't know if that's there.
16:23 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah, I mean, I think in terms of a meaningful goal, this probably
relates to growth.
16:29 - Laura Dolphin: Okay.
16:30 - Adrian Boerstra: So I would include a growth goal here.
16:36 - Adrian Boerstra: And.
16:39 - Laura Dolphin: Like grow scale without increasing overhead.
16:42 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah.
16:46 - Laura Dolphin: Okay.
16:47 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah.
16:48 - Laura Dolphin: I'll just leave the light.
16:50 - Adrian Boerstra: So preparing for growth.
16:51 - Adrian Boerstra: And it'd be nice if we could get an idea on how much he's looking
to grow by.
16:56 - Adrian Boerstra: Cause I'll bet he has an idea.
16:58 - Laura Dolphin: Okay.
16:58 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
17:00 - Adrian Boerstra: look in the double in the next two years, I'll bet he has some big lofty
goals.
17:08 - Adrian Boerstra: No problem, but let's try to get some measurables where we can
on this, because that will really help us to go.
17:21 - Adrian Boerstra: When you start to look at the technology initiatives that we have,
you might start to go, wait a minute, he wants to grow by double by next year.
17:32 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah, this thing that we're going to do might help to grow by 10%,
but if he grows by double, the solution we're implementing here is going to break as well.
17:44 - Adrian Boerstra: So we have to prepare for the rate of growth that he's trying to
achieve through his business plans and that he feels is realistic.
17:51 - Adrian Boerstra: So we have to build for the scale and the processes, and we have
to be able to highlight
17:57 - Adrian Boerstra: him that, hey, if we do this, and that's all we get done by the end of
this year, your technology's
18:04 - Adrian Boerstra: still going to hold you back from achieving what you want to achieve.
18:07 - Adrian Boerstra: So, you see how having those
18:10 - Adrian Boerstra: goals and understanding just the pace at which we're trying to do
things and everything really
18:15 - Adrian Boerstra: informs that tech layer in terms of the solutions, because you could
end up implementing something
18:22 - Adrian Boerstra: that's better than it is today, but still isn't good enough to help them
achieve what
18:26 - Adrian Boerstra: they want to achieve.
18:29 - Laura Dolphin: Okay.
18:34 - Laura Dolphin: Those are really the only ones I know of then.
18:37 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah, I mean, those are like, those are the overall categories that I
see time and time again.
18:42 - Adrian Boerstra: It's like you're either reducing costs, increasing revenue, increasing
operational efficiency, or you've got growth goals.
18:50 - Adrian Boerstra: So those tend to be the main categories and then everything else
is like gonna be subheadings under that.
18:56 - Adrian Boerstra: But I think like that's your true north.
18:59 - Adrian Boerstra: That is your compass for everything else.
19:03 - Adrian Boerstra: And that becomes your measuring stick for deciding whether or not
these other technology things are actually supporting, are worth doing or architected right.
19:14 - Adrian Boerstra: He wants to go.
19:17 - Laura Dolphin: Okay.
19:18 - Laura Dolphin: So then now what do I do?
19:20 - Laura Dolphin: I like draw a line from each of these to the relevant things?
19:23 - Adrian Boerstra: I don't even, can you draw a line?
19:26 - Adrian Boerstra: I don't know.
19:27 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
19:27 - Adrian Boerstra: I knew this was here, but I haven't specifically used.
19:32 - Adrian Boerstra: I am kind of curious.
19:33 - Adrian Boerstra: Click on the little Gemini icon.
19:36 - Laura Dolphin: What's the Gemini?
19:37 - Adrian Boerstra: Remember that Ai one?
19:38 - Adrian Boerstra: That's that star just above the toolbar.
19:42 - Laura Dolphin: Oh, yeah, yeah.
19:47 - Adrian Boerstra: I don't know if it shows something for you.
19:48 - Adrian Boerstra: and should, like, if you, can you say to Gemini?
19:54 - Laura Dolphin: You want a mind map?
19:58 - Adrian Boerstra: Oh, I guess, do you see it?
19:59 - Adrian Boerstra: Just above the, oh, I guess this is collaborative.
20:02 - Adrian Boerstra: I can.
20:02 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah, you can play too.
20:04 - Adrian Boerstra: I can play too, okay.
20:06 - Adrian Boerstra: If I click on Ai companion, oh, generate content with Ai companion.
20:11 - Adrian Boerstra: Okay, continue.
20:12 - Laura Dolphin: Okay, so, what do I want to ask?
20:16 - Adrian Boerstra: Oh my gosh, yeah.
20:17 - Adrian Boerstra: Do you have that same thing open?
20:18 - Adrian Boerstra: what do you want to create?
20:19 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah, so.
20:21 - Adrian Boerstra: I don't know, try Mind Map.
20:24 - Laura Dolphin: Oh, okay, like there.
20:26 - Adrian Boerstra: I wonder if it's gonna listen to our conversation and Mind Map it out.
20:29 - Laura Dolphin: Maybe.
20:32 - Laura Dolphin: Why have we never done this before?
20:34 - Laura Dolphin: Oh, it literally just creates you like a template.
20:40 - Laura Dolphin: Refine.
20:42 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah, try refine.
20:44 - Laura Dolphin: Okay, let me just go ahead and.
20:45 - Adrian Boerstra: It is, by the way, listening to our conversation so that everything
we've talked about it has this context.
20:50 - Adrian Boerstra: So just tell it to mind map out our conversation so far.
20:58 - Adrian Boerstra: I can't because I have a coffee in my hand.
21:06 - Laura Dolphin: I love it.
21:08 - Laura Dolphin: Full legit excuse.
21:13 - Laura Dolphin: So lazy Adrian.
21:15 - Adrian Boerstra: It's true.
21:17 - Laura Dolphin: Something went wrong, please try again.
21:19 - Laura Dolphin: It didn't like that.
21:23 - Adrian Boerstra: Because I have just played with this a little bit where you can ask it
questions about what have we said so far.
21:29 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah, I've been using that one since you and I like discovered that
from the conversation.
21:40 - Laura Dolphin: Let's try that.
21:48 - Laura Dolphin: No.
21:51 - Adrian Boerstra: Hang on, let's dissect.
21:53 - Adrian Boerstra: Let me zoom in a little bit.
21:55 - Laura Dolphin: It's like politics, global issues.
21:59 - Adrian Boerstra: Oh, yeah.
22:00 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
22:01 - Laura Dolphin: Conversation topics.
22:03 - Adrian Boerstra: Not quite.
22:04 - Adrian Boerstra: Well, it looks like it's still thinking.
22:06 - Laura Dolphin: Oh, oops.
22:07 - Adrian Boerstra: Okay.
22:09 - Adrian Boerstra: Let's not get distracted with the tech.
22:12 - Adrian Boerstra: I think there's probably something cool there if we work it out.
22:16 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
22:16 - Laura Dolphin: Um, where'd my hand go?
22:21 - Adrian Boerstra: Ai-generated content may be inaccurate, offensive, or misleading.
22:27 - Laura Dolphin: Huh.
22:29 - Laura Dolphin: Where's my little hand?
22:31 - Laura Dolphin: Um.
22:37 - Laura Dolphin: What the?
22:38 - Laura Dolphin: I'm trying to like drag it.
22:40 - Laura Dolphin: Oh there it is.
22:41 - Laura Dolphin: It's down here, silly.
22:42 - Laura Dolphin: Ok.
22:45 - Laura Dolphin: Ok, so let me just clean these up.
22:47 - Laura Dolphin: Ok, so is it like ink?
22:50 - Laura Dolphin: Oh you can't edit it anymore.
22:52 - Laura Dolphin: I can't edit it anymore.
22:53 - Laura Dolphin: Right?
22:58 - Adrian Boerstra: I'm doing and moving around.
22:59 - Adrian Boerstra: Does it move it around for you too?
23:01 - Laura Dolphin: No.
23:02 - Adrian Boerstra: Okay, good.
23:03 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah.
23:05 - Laura Dolphin: So if I just go like that.
23:12 - Adrian Boerstra: You don't have to draw the line if you don't want, because this isn't
going to be a clean enough diagram that we're going to present it.
23:18 - Adrian Boerstra: This is just, and we've talked it through.
23:20 - Laura Dolphin: There.
23:21 - Adrian Boerstra: So it's okay.
23:22 - Laura Dolphin: Okay.
23:23 - Laura Dolphin: So now what do I do?
23:24 - Adrian Boerstra: Let's just talk it through though and go through each one of these
and think about how they tie back to these goals, whether you're driving or not.
23:33 - Laura Dolphin: Okay, so one click contract is increasing efficiency.
23:43 - Laura Dolphin: It's a time saver.
23:45 - Laura Dolphin: That's really what that is.
23:46 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
23:48 - Laura Dolphin: E, notary.
23:50 - Adrian Boerstra: And maybe let's know if there's bonus, if you think that these are
going to be big wins
23:54 - Adrian Boerstra: for the employees and helping him to gain support, you know, with
him, like if he's
24:03 - Adrian Boerstra: going, if they're going to get on board and he's going to win people
over with everything
24:08 - Adrian Boerstra: else that he's trying to do, and that's going to help him pick up steam,
let's note that
24:11 - Adrian Boerstra: on any of these as well.
24:13 - Laura Dolphin: Okay.
24:13 - Adrian Boerstra: What are the things that are going to be seen as employee wins
versus management wins?
24:21 - Laura Dolphin: So the automated application intake at the bottom, that's a win.
24:26 - Adrian Boerstra: That's a big win for employees.
24:28 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
24:32 - Laura Dolphin: The automated document management, so that is quite a big one that
encompasses like Aio for the funding checklist, and automated documents into Box, that is
probably the biggest out of any of these.
24:50 - Laura Dolphin: If not, that one and the automated application intake are the big
employee wins.
24:54 - Laura Dolphin: Those are the time savers, those are the efficiency gains, those are
what users spend all their time doing.
25:02 - Laura Dolphin: Okay.
25:03 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
25:03 - Laura Dolphin: So those ones called out.
25:05 - Laura Dolphin: So the automated document management, that ties to increasing
efficiency.
25:11 - Laura Dolphin: And it's probably directly linked as well to increasing revenue because
users spend so much time doing that, that they basically, like, you know, they can only do so
many, fund so many deals in a day because they're spending so much time doing that.
25:28 - Laura Dolphin: And that is also potentially linked to like growing and scaling.
25:32 - Laura Dolphin: Cause if we can solve for that, It reduces a lot of the time overhead
that's needed.
25:42 - Laura Dolphin: Ok, so e-notary, I honestly don't really know.
25:45 - Laura Dolphin: I just know it's a thing that they want to do.
25:48 - Laura Dolphin: I would think it would be just like an efficiency thing, but I'm not 100%
sure.
25:52 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah, e-notary would be, yeah, I think that's going to be an efficiency
thing, because e-notary is.
26:03 - Laura Dolphin: someone notarizing it.
26:05 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah, if that's going to, well, it's also increasing revenue from the
perspective of, I believe that they're kind of in, like, they're not, it's not like they know that
they're the only funder that received an application.
26:19 - Adrian Boerstra: So anything that speeds the overall calendar time it takes to get
things done.
26:27 - Adrian Boerstra: Like, you know, the funder, the funder that is going to work the
fastest, yeah, to close more deals.
26:33 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah, okay.
26:34 - Laura Dolphin: I have another meeting that's starting.
26:37 - Adrian Boerstra: Okay.
26:38 - Laura Dolphin: Let me just spit this out real quick and then we can go back another
time.
26:42 - Laura Dolphin: So, scoring models.
26:48 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah, no worries.
26:49 - Laura Dolphin: Oh, he said it'll be on in five minutes, so we're good.
26:51 - Laura Dolphin: Scoring models is tied to reducing loss and repos due to nonpayment
and potentially increasing revenue.
27:04 - Laura Dolphin: Staff accountability targets and measurement, that is growing and
scaling without increasing overhead and employee retention, so increasing efficiency, like
employee retention and reducing employee turnover.
27:26 - Laura Dolphin: Or wait, no.
27:27 - Laura Dolphin: Might just be growing and scaling without increasing overhead.
27:31 - Laura Dolphin: Credit approval processes
27:36 - Laura Dolphin: growing and scaling without increasing overhead, and
27:42 - Laura Dolphin: I don't really think of revenue, but it will increase efficiency.
27:50 - Laura Dolphin: Marketing and communications.
27:54 - Laura Dolphin: This one's quite broad, so that probably fits in anything.
27:56 - Laura Dolphin: If anything, I think that there's some potential.
27:59 - Laura Dolphin: It's definitely increasing efficiency, and it's also growing and scaling
without increasing overhead, because it's so manual.
28:07 - Laura Dolphin: But I also see potentials for increasing revenue.
28:12 - Laura Dolphin: Actually, it fits into all of them because it also there's use cases that
they could use for reducing loss and repos due to nonpayment.
28:22 - Laura Dolphin: Okay, any issues with anything that I said there?
28:28 - Adrian Boerstra: Nope, keep going.
28:29 - Laura Dolphin: I'm done.
28:30 - Laura Dolphin: That's it.
28:31 - Laura Dolphin: We did.
28:31 - Laura Dolphin: So automated application intake and automated document manage-
ment.
28:35 - Laura Dolphin: We're done.
28:36 - Laura Dolphin: Okay.
28:36 - Laura Dolphin: I think we're good.
28:39 - Laura Dolphin: Okay.
28:40 - Adrian Boerstra: Sounds good.
28:41 - Adrian Boerstra: Is there any timing around this that, like, has he given you any
priorities around this?
28:48 - Adrian Boerstra: Or is this all just concurrent ideas that he's like, yeah.
28:52 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah.
28:54 - Laura Dolphin: Well, he wants everything as soon as humanly possible.
28:57 - Laura Dolphin: Ok.
28:58 - Laura Dolphin: So right now, you're going to get some sort of, so like the automated
document management, the one click contract, the automated application intake are top.
29:09 - Laura Dolphin: The scoring models is also top, but that's kind of, a lot of it doesn't lie
on us.
29:14 - Laura Dolphin: We only have a little part in it.
29:15 - Laura Dolphin: Ok.
29:16 - Laura Dolphin: So those are the top, and then everything else kind of comes after.
29:19 - Adrian Boerstra: Sounds good.
29:20 - Adrian Boerstra: In one minute or less, can you talk about the current process around
what are the kinds of administrative tasks that come your way?
29:27 - Adrian Boerstra: How is that being handled?
29:28 - Adrian Boerstra: How is it being handled internally?
29:31 - Adrian Boerstra: So what is the level of effort right now and processes around just
maintaining the system and supporting users?
29:41 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah, so issues get logged in multiple ways, Google Chat, email, or
on a call.
29:48 - Laura Dolphin: They all come through me.
29:50 - Laura Dolphin: Items are sometimes administration, like user management permis-
sions.
29:55 - Laura Dolphin: A lot of the time support, like something's broken, I need this fixed.
30:00 - Laura Dolphin: And a lot of them are just simple requests, like I need a report or I don't
know where this is or help me with this process.
30:07 - Laura Dolphin: All of that is usually logged into Jira by myself, unless it's like a two
minute job and tracked under usually like support or user management.
30:17 - Adrian Boerstra: Okay, do you tag it differently in Clockify or just in Jira?
30:20 - Laura Dolphin: Both.
30:21 - Laura Dolphin: I usually start my time entries with support and then whatever it was,
or like admin, whatever it was, or if it's user management, user management.
30:31 - Laura Dolphin: And then I have epics in Jira where I'll create tasks for them to track.
30:36 - Adrian Boerstra: Do you have any regular reports that you provide to Michael today?
30:42 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah, different formats.
30:44 - Laura Dolphin: I've kind of been trying some out.
30:45 - Laura Dolphin: on the steering committee, I present pretty much all of Jira by the
status to show completed work, work in progress, backlog, prioritized, and then new items
that have been created in the last couple of weeks, and users go through the process with
me of prioritizing.
31:01 - Adrian Boerstra: Okay, what about meetings cadences?
31:03 - Adrian Boerstra: I know there's a once a week meeting with Michael where you're
giving him updates on where we're at.
31:10 - Adrian Boerstra: Do you have like a fixed agenda for that, or is that just a general
update?
31:15 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah, so we have the steering committee meeting with a lot of
representation from the business every Monday where we go through all of the items to
prioritize so that they can tell me what they want.
31:29 - Laura Dolphin: Michael and I then meet on Thursdays for half an hour.
31:32 - Laura Dolphin: I give him an update just on time.
31:34 - Laura Dolphin: I call out anything that I might need from him in order to move ahead.
31:40 - Laura Dolphin: and then him and I discuss higher level issues that are not steering
committee.
31:46 - Laura Dolphin: In between that, there are meetings that get created ad hoc on specific
issues all the time.
31:53 - Adrian Boerstra: Okay, and ideally, do you try to work in sprints?
31:58 - Adrian Boerstra: Do you do any kind of scrum or is it like, what's the project
management methodology that you're looking at all of this through?
32:06 - Laura Dolphin: Chaos, I don't.
32:08 - Laura Dolphin: I may, I have floated that idea with myself cause it's just me.
32:14 - Adrian Boerstra: Yeah, what did you think of it?
32:16 - Laura Dolphin: So I don't sprint.
32:18 - Adrian Boerstra: Did you argue?
32:19 - Laura Dolphin: What?
32:20 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah, I argued.
32:20 - Adrian Boerstra: You argued it out.
32:22 - Laura Dolphin: I did, yeah, it was a heated conversation.
32:25 - Adrian Boerstra: I haven't- Brushing, biting, hair pulling, yeah.
32:27 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah, it's pretty much that's kind of where I need to move to around
like a structure.
32:34 - Laura Dolphin: I have been getting into more of a cadence around like getting the
priorities from the business, we're all on the same page.
32:43 - Laura Dolphin: And then it's kind of like I do those.
32:44 - Laura Dolphin: And then I show for them all of those issues
32:47 - Laura Dolphin: that have been coming up, like support or requests
32:50 - Laura Dolphin: so that they can understand like why things are
32:53 - Laura Dolphin: but there isn't really the concept of a two week sprint
32:55 - Laura Dolphin: because we don't really have a lot of those things to find.
32:58 - Laura Dolphin: That being said, I really do have to jump on the other call.
33:01 - Adrian Boerstra: Sorry.
33:01 - Adrian Boerstra: Okay, sounds good.
33:02 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah, I'll reach out and we can go through next steps.
33:06 - Adrian Boerstra: Great, thanks Laura.
33:07 - Laura Dolphin: Cool, thank you.
33:08 - Laura Dolphin: Okay, bye.
33:08 - Adrian Boerstra: Bye.
