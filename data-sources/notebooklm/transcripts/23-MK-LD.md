Maxim x Faye Planning Transcript
00:52 - Michael Kianmahd: Hello.
00:55 - Laura: How you doing?
00:56 - Laura: Good, how are you?
00:57 - Michael Kianmahd: Pretty good.
00:59 - Michael Kianmahd: Good.
00:59 - Michael Kianmahd: Quick thing for you, I copied you on your Maxim email something
related to Conga.
01:06 - Michael Kianmahd: Okay.
01:07 - Michael Kianmahd: Did you see that by any chance?
01:09 - Michael Kianmahd: No.
01:11 - Laura: Okay.
01:12 - Michael Kianmahd: What's that?
01:17 - Laura: Is it the urgent thing?
01:19 - Michael Kianmahd: According to them, everything's urgent when they want money.
01:22 - Laura: Oh yeah.
01:24 - Michael Kianmahd: You're out of compliance, so we need to charge you$4,000.
01:31 - Laura: Hang on, sorry.
01:32 - Laura: Please make the request for – oh, yeah.
01:35 - Laura: Michael, just – Dldesk, reach out and let you know that your account is
over-utilizing Congo Composer transactions.
01:42 - Laura: Do they play talking to someone, do you creating anywhere from?
01:55 - Laura: Yeah, so.
01:57 - Michael Kianmahd: It doesn't really make sense to me because we're not doing that
much business.
02:02 - Laura: It doesn't have anything to do with business.
02:03 - Laura: So Conga is used every time that a user clicks the document merge button.
02:08 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah.
02:10 - Laura: they basically are utilizing a transaction.
02:16 - Laura: And I know the, like, I think Hebert and his team use it.
02:19 - Laura: I don't know how they're using it.
02:21 - Laura: Like, I don't know really enough about that.
02:23 - Laura: I just know that team uses it.
02:26 - Laura: So basically anytime you are merging information from Salesforce with Conga,
that's a transaction.
02:39 - Laura: I'm just thinking, sorry, like
02:42 - Laura: the only real way to reduce that.
02:45 - Laura: So, sorry, let me just turn these off.
02:50 - Laura: Distracting me, Adrian.
02:55 - Laura: Yeah, so they're primarily used before we send the document, the Docusign.
03:04 - Laura: So, the only way to really way to like reduce that in that area is to send the
contract later.
03:15 - Laura: If like that's physically possible.
03:17 - Laura: So, for example, if you're sending the contract, they sign it and then like still
10% of deals fall out.
03:25 - Laura: and if you can send it later so that you reduce the chance that you're sending
contracts on deals that don't actually get funded, that's the only real way to reduce that.
03:39 - Laura: I don't know enough about Hubert and his team or anyone outside of the Scent
Docusign to know how they're using Conga, and know how to reduce it.
03:48 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah, so can you show me where I could see the data?
03:54 - Laura: Um, usually yes.
03:58 - Michael Kianmahd: Because I was told that there's a Conga app.
04:01 - Laura: Yep.
04:02 - Michael Kianmahd: But the one he was trying to click on doesn't show up on my
screen.
04:06 - Laura: Yeah, hang on here.
04:07 - Laura: Let's so.
04:10 - Michael Kianmahd: He called me, it was like, I couldn't really do.
04:14 - Laura: But I don't, I don't actually know.
04:17 - Laura: if you use Konga sign, it stores a record of the transactions.
04:25 - Laura: You're to be honest, I'm like, I haven't actually looked.
04:32 - Laura: I don't know.
04:35 - Michael Kianmahd: What if we do like a quick poll with them?
04:38 - Michael Kianmahd: Yep.
04:39 - Laura: Yeah, we can do that.
04:45 - Michael Kianmahd: Because for transactions.
04:47 - Laura: Did he tell you where you monitor that?
04:51 - Michael Kianmahd: He did, but I like he's, hmm, can you go, so I replied to that email,
could you pull up my reply?
05:04 - Laura: This is...
05:10 - Michael Kianmahd: I hate conversation view, by the way.
05:11 - Michael Kianmahd: If you want to turn that off, I could show you how to do it.
05:14 - Laura: Yeah.
05:15 - Laura: Actually, like, yeah.
05:17 - Laura: How do you do that?
05:18 - Michael Kianmahd: Ok, go to Settings.
05:21 - Laura: This guy?
05:22 - Michael Kianmahd: Scroll down.
05:25 - Michael Kianmahd: I like compact.
05:26 - Michael Kianmahd: Click Compact.
05:27 - Michael Kianmahd: Might be cleaner.
05:30 - Michael Kianmahd: And then unread first.
05:33 - Michael Kianmahd: Scroll down.
05:36 - Michael Kianmahd: And then scroll down.
05:39 - Laura: Yeah, Ok.
05:40 - Michael Kianmahd: And then conversation view, do you see that?
05:42 - Laura: Yeah.
05:43 - Michael Kianmahd: Just click that.
05:46 - Michael Kianmahd: And then reload.
05:48 - Laura: I haven't used Gmail in a minute.
05:51 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah.
05:53 - Michael Kianmahd: It's horrible.
05:57 - Laura: Ok, so this, oh, God.
06:02 - Michael Kianmahd: Just search the word urgent, and then it'll probably pop up.
06:09 - Laura: Ah, Ok.
06:11 - Laura: Oh, it's just a report.
06:12 - Laura: Ok.
06:14 - Laura: And that's through the portal.
06:15 - Laura: That's not actually in Salesforce.
06:17 - Michael Kianmahd: It's not my reply.
06:19 - Michael Kianmahd: You've got to look for my reply.
06:21 - Michael Kianmahd: Ok.
06:26 - Laura: Christian, can we chat today?
06:28 - Laura: Are you talking with where?
06:39 - Michael Kianmahd: So, it's the next email called urgent.
06:43 - Laura: Okay.
06:48 - Michael Kianmahd: Sorry, Laura.
06:49 - Michael Kianmahd: Just click enter like when you do that you're not Serving your
screen.
06:54 - Michael Kianmahd: I like Loss at what we're trying to accomplish Yeah, so I'm just
showing you that Like, you know, you just that was the email I was referring to Okay, but
basically my and oh, okay.
07:10 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah, so this is just like unread now Yeah, I'm trying to teach you
how to use Gmail and also trying to solve our conga merge problem at the same time Don't
worry about that.
07:18 - Laura: Just tell me what your problem is and how I can help.
07:20 - Laura: I'm going to stop sharing because this is a good idea.
07:23 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah, I think we should.
07:25 - Michael Kianmahd: First of all, when I communicate, I need your help on something.
07:28 - Michael Kianmahd: Should I email your max email, Faye or both?
07:31 - Laura: Faye.
07:32 - Laura: You can cc max him too, but I only go into my max and email if I need to, i.e.
07:38 - Laura: if I'm testing or something.
07:39 - Laura: If you need me, my Faye is where you contact me.
07:42 - Michael Kianmahd: If you want to just reply all to that email and see if we could
schedule 15 minutes with this guy to have the conversation about utilization and make sure
we understand how to measure how much Congo licenses we're using.
07:55 - Michael Kianmahd: So, because it's pretty expensive.
07:59 - Laura: Yeah.
08:00 - Michael Kianmahd: So, I just want to do this thoughtfully.
08:02 - Michael Kianmahd: Like, you know, I hate these conversations where like they call
you and it's like an incrementalist discussion.
08:07 - Michael Kianmahd: You have no idea how the contract really is structured.
08:09 - Michael Kianmahd: Like, oh, we just need more money from you.
08:11 - Michael Kianmahd: Like, I want to avoid those and I want to be like somewhat
strategic and thoughtful about how we spend money on software.
08:18 - Laura: Closing under 100,000, so I'm going to clear my questions.
08:20 - Laura: The chat is so high.
08:22 - Laura: Okay, sorry, I see your email now.
08:24 - Laura: Yeah, so the link he said is in the Conga, so can you give me some time to sort
out my end, and I'll come back to you?
08:34 - Michael Kianmahd: Sure.
08:35 - Laura: Yeah?
08:35 - Laura: Okay.
08:36 - Michael Kianmahd: Sure.
08:37 - Laura: Okay.
08:38 - Laura: I've been building the demo for the roles.
08:43 - Laura: I've been doing that and then I've been on calls, so I haven't really looked at
anything else.
08:47 - Michael Kianmahd: It's okay.
08:48 - Laura: That's pretty standard for me.
08:49 - Michael Kianmahd: I just wanted to flag that for you because he made it sound super
urgent.
08:55 - Laura: I mean, for them it is because it's like Salesforce, when you're over your data,
they're going to chase you because it's money.
09:02 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah.
09:03 - Laura: Okay.
09:04 - Laura: I will have a look.
09:05 - Laura: I will let you know and I will figure out a way if we can reduce it, or I will just
come back to you and say.
09:13 - Laura: There's no way to reduce it at this point in time.
09:15 - Laura: You need to pay.
09:18 - Laura: And then we can work on a strategy of, like.
09:20 - Laura: How to fix it going forward because I don't it is what it is.
09:24 - Laura: It's 1 of those things.
09:25 - Laura: Um, but let me.
09:29 - Laura: Okay, so I have a short agenda.
09:32 - Laura: I have one main question that I want from you today.
09:34 - Laura: And then if you like, I can show you all of the new requests in the last 14 days.
09:40 - Laura: I'll just like show you my giraffe so you can get a view into like, what I've been
doing and why, if that would be helpful.
09:49 - Michael Kianmahd: Sure.
09:50 - Laura: And so ours, you're aware, I saw the emails, Dave is gonna schedule a call with
you next week.
09:57 - Laura: So just like leave the conversation if you like for now.
10:01 - Laura: We're at 160 or 150, or just 160 for the month.
10:09 - Laura: So the use case I have, picking up on our conversation from yesterday.
10:14 - Laura: So Juan brought up a really, separate call.
10:17 - Laura: Juan brought up a really good use case
10:19 - Laura: where you do a case, like as an edge case
10:24 - Laura: if you have an individual who comes to you
10:28 - Laura: and then you fund a deal, so like Jane Doe
10:31 - Laura: and then you fund it, and then maybe like a year later
10:35 - Laura: Jane registers a business and she comes back to you
10:38 - Laura: and she needs another loan, but right now
10:41 - Laura: at this point in time, she has a new business
10:44 - Laura: called Jane's Trucks, whatever it is.
10:47 - Laura: So what Juan said that you guys are currently doing is, cause in Salesforce,
you would have an account for Jane Doe and then you'd have a contact for Jane Doe and
both of those would be named Jane Doe.
10:58 - Laura: They just changed the name of the account from Jane Doe to Gaines Trucks.
11:05 - Laura: Is that what you would want to happen in your business?
11:12 - Michael Kianmahd: No, I think it's a different account, but you have like a related
contact.
11:18 - Laura: Yeah, okay.
11:18 - Laura: That's what I said to him as well.
11:20 - Laura: Because if you change Jane Doe to Jane's Trucks on the old opportunity, it
would appear as Jane's Trucks.
11:28 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah.
11:28 - Laura: And you would be recognizable.
11:30 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah.
11:31 - Laura: Okay, that answers my question.
11:33 - Michael Kianmahd: Um, you know, I think this goes back to just like the structure of
like accounts and opportunities and parent-child relationship, yeah so
11:46 - Michael Kianmahd: Obviously people's lives of all I think
11:54 - Michael Kianmahd: Think when you consider what we do we finance companies
Sometimes those companies are sole proprietors, meaning they're done, the financing is
done in the name of the individual.
12:06 - Michael Kianmahd: Sometimes there's a legal entity.
12:10 - Michael Kianmahd: If we're financing a legal entity, that technically is the account.
12:15 - Michael Kianmahd: If we're financing an individual, that technically is an account.
12:19 - Michael Kianmahd: And then under those accounts, we should have opportunities.
12:23 - Michael Kianmahd: If an account is created initially under an individual, and then that
individual commercializes their business and sets up a legal entity, you could theoretically
create an opportunity as the new entity name, correct?
12:42 - Laura: Yeah, you would.
12:43 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah.
12:44 - Michael Kianmahd: The account initially starts as the person, stays the person
throughout the second deal, and the second, the opportunity is the entity name.
12:56 - Laura: Yeah, so, but I guess the question would be on the actual account, where
would you reflect that she has a business, that like it's Jane's Trucks?
13:04 - Michael Kianmahd: It would be at the opportunity level.
13:07 - Michael Kianmahd: It wouldn't create a new account for Jane because an account
for Jane already exists, but she initially applied as a sole proprietor.
13:17 - Laura: When you say sole proprietor, Is that the same thing as legal entity?
13:21 - Michael Kianmahd: No, sole proprietor is like, Laura wants to do sales consulting on
her end, then she just, like Laura Dolphin is the one providing service, and they pay Laura
Dolphin.
13:30 - Michael Kianmahd: And all the contracts are written in your personal name with your
clients.
13:36 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah, but if you started like, Laura Salesforce Consulting Inc.
13:40 - Laura: Ah.
13:41 - Michael Kianmahd: Or Laura Consulting Llc.
13:44 - Laura: Okay.
13:44 - Michael Kianmahd: And then the Llc is 100% owned by Laura Dolphin.
13:48 - Michael Kianmahd: And Lauren Dolphin is signing on behalf of the company, not
herself individually as a sole proprietor, that's the difference.
13:56 - Laura: So what's the difference between an individual and a sole proprietor then?
13:59 - Michael Kianmahd: A sole proprietor is an individual who runs a business in their
name.
14:08 - Michael Kianmahd: So you could be an individual guarantor.
14:11 - Michael Kianmahd: You could also be like an individual sole proprietor.
14:14 - Michael Kianmahd: And the sole proprietor is not necessarily the debtor and the
guarantor.
14:21 - Michael Kianmahd: The sole proprietor is basically the debtor, then the guarantor can
also be another individual who's not the sole proprietor.
14:29 - Laura: Right.
14:29 - Laura: Okay.
14:35 - Laura: That makes sense.
14:36 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah.
14:37 - Michael Kianmahd: Okay.
14:37 - Laura: So then going back to the use case, if they come in as an individual and then
they later have a legal entity or sole proprietor, like either which way?
14:51 - Laura: Would we still want to be able to see that the original deal was done under the
individual, and then the new deal was essentially like it's a new legal entity?
15:04 - Michael Kianmahd: I mean, I don't really have a strong opinion about this, but what
makes logical sense
15:08 - Michael Kianmahd: to me is like, if you've already created an account for the person
and want another loan
15:13 - Michael Kianmahd: but this time under the name of the company that they just
created, I wonder if we could
15:17 - Michael Kianmahd: just create that opportunity with the company name under the
account that already exists
15:22 - Michael Kianmahd: rather than changing the account name.
15:24 - Laura: Yes.
15:25 - Laura: So flip it on its head from like a marketing communications kind of standpoint.
15:34 - Laura: They don't really look at opportunities and especially they don't know about
that from the name.
15:39 - Laura: They can't decipher if it's like a business from the name.
15:41 - Laura: Do you tailor or care about the fact that this person that we're communicating
to is a person or a business?
15:51 - Laura: Is that something that you guys need to know for any other department?
16:00 - Michael Kianmahd: I think for marketing purposes, we're always communicating to
a person.
16:05 - Michael Kianmahd: Yes, I think.
16:09 - Laura: But would you start in trouble?
16:10 - Laura: Would you like, communicate them differently if they were an individual versus
if they are like a sole provider or a legal entity?
16:18 - Michael Kianmahd: The only messaging differences are borrowers and lessees as
one category.
16:24 - Michael Kianmahd: Okay.
16:25 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah.
16:26 - Laura: Debtors.
16:27 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah.
16:27 - Michael Kianmahd: Sorry.
16:27 - Michael Kianmahd: Debtors and lessees as one category.
16:31 - Laura: Yeah.
16:33 - Michael Kianmahd: Brokers as another category.
16:36 - Laura: And then dealers.
16:37 - Michael Kianmahd: And dealers or vendors as another category.
16:40 - Laura: Yeah.
16:42 - Michael Kianmahd: So like, that's the only reason why we would care about the
company name.
16:47 - Laura: Okay.
16:48 - Michael Kianmahd: But I think we have contact record types, right?
16:57 - Laura: Yes.
16:58 - Michael Kianmahd: I think it's actually, I forget what it's called, but it's...
17:02 - Laura: It's a type, it's a formula field on the contact that pulls from the account, so it
tells you if the contact's an applicant or a vendor or a broker.
17:12 - Laura: I think that's probably what you're referring to.
17:15 - Michael Kianmahd: Let me just double click into that.
17:25 - Laura: I think you're probably referring to like this.
17:31 - Michael Kianmahd: Yes, account type.
17:33 - Laura: Yeah, that's just a formula field that literally pulls from the account.
17:37 - Laura: And so if the account's an applicant, it says applicant.
17:41 - Laura: If it's a vendor, it says vendor.
17:43 - Laura: If it's a whatever, it just takes that.
17:46 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah, so that's account type.
17:49 - Laura: Okay.
17:51 - Michael Kianmahd: So that's what we use to differentiate marketing messages.
17:56 - Michael Kianmahd: And if you look at the types, there's a very long list.
18:00 - Laura: Yes.
18:00 - Laura: We're gonna fix those.
18:03 - Laura: I do it with those.
18:04 - Laura: Okay, I think that answers my question enough to give you the, to finish like
the little demo and then pick up the combo for there.
18:13 - Laura: So I'll finish that off today.
18:15 - Laura: That's what I'm working on.
18:17 - Laura: And then I should have the video in a few hours.
18:20 - Laura: It shouldn't take too much longer.
18:22 - Michael Kianmahd: Great, how's all your chat with Dave and everybody going?
18:26 - Laura: Yeah, good.
18:27 - Laura: So I'm meeting with Adrian on Tuesday to do like roadmap stuff.
18:33 - Laura: And then Dave's going to go and get with you.
18:36 - Laura: And him and I, Dave and I were working late last week on the Jira access, and
we got it like so close.
18:41 - Laura: And I just followed up with him.
18:43 - Laura: I haven't heard back about where he's at with that, but we're pretty close on
that.
18:48 - Laura: I think we're just going to keep going with like the Jira just because it's what I
use, and I have so much stuff in there.
18:56 - Laura: At least for now, and if you don't like it, then we've got a whole, we've got other
tools and stuff that we could potentially give you.
19:06 - Laura: That integrate, so it'll just like push.
19:10 - Laura: Yeah, okay, so this, I'll just quickly go through this.
19:15 - Laura: I don't wanna go through it ticket by ticket.
19:18 - Laura: I just wanted to give you an idea of like, in the last 14 days, these are all of the
new tickets that have been created.
19:27 - Laura: Probably about 65% have been inserted by me just for like things that we have
to do or things that we wanna do, having a conversation with you.
19:39 - Laura: And then the other percentage have come direct from users.
19:43 - Laura: So you can see a few of them are like little ones that were associated to the
new deal intake that came in either right at, like right before the launch or after.
19:55 - Laura: And so those ones are just like little fixes and requests from primarily Louis,
Charles or the users.
20:05 - Laura: There's things related to Aio and the deployment.
20:08 - Laura: And so where that's at just Fyi, it's like ready to go, except some of the Apex
classes just need to be updated.
20:15 - Laura: So I just have my engineer who's gonna work on that tomorrow morning and
then we should be able to get that into prod and out, everything else is ready to go.
20:22 - Laura: I have the key for production, I've got the change sets, half of it's actually
deployed into production and the other half is just waiting on the test classes.
20:30 - Laura: So that's where that's at.
20:33 - Laura: And then if we scroll down here, you'll see these are all like, what I did is I, for
deal intake, there's a lot of like, oh, I'd love to have this, or Louie would say, can it do this?
20:45 - Laura: And if it wasn't like a, you need this in order to use it, I've just created it as like
backlog items.
20:54 - Laura: Yeah, if they were like, oh, this is gonna cause issues, I've just done it.
20:59 - Laura: Specifically, if it's gonna cause issues with things like Aio or other like
automations, I've just done it.
21:07 - Laura: There is- Can I comment on that?
21:08 - Laura: Yeah, please do.
21:10 - Michael Kianmahd: So the way I think about this is, Um, if it's like needed for like the
operation to actually function.
21:19 - Michael Kianmahd: Like it's preventing us from doing what we need to do.
21:22 - Michael Kianmahd: Yes, that's high priority.
21:24 - Michael Kianmahd: Okay, if it's then if it's a nice to have and no one really can explain
how much better and more efficient their life will be as a result.
21:35 - Michael Kianmahd: Okay, it's probably a backlight a backlog item.
21:42 - Michael Kianmahd: But I'm worried about missing opportunities like that because of
somebody's inability to explain.
21:46 - Michael Kianmahd: So what I think we should do is like spend maybe at least every
other week on the steering committee and just run through your list and touch them.
21:56 - Laura: You've nailed it.
21:57 - Laura: So that's what we're going to do on Monday.
21:58 - Laura: So I did cancel Monday this time because there was just so much else going
on.
22:03 - Laura: But I totally agree.
22:04 - Laura: And this is kind of where I want to highlight and just say, like, this is the way I
go about it.
22:08 - Laura: go about it.
22:08 - Laura: I usually am pretty good as well as knowing even if the user doesn't is not able
to articulate.
22:15 - Laura: And like an example yesterday, Louis was like, Oh, I had an issue with the deal
intake.
22:23 - Laura: And I went and saw what it was.
22:24 - Laura: And he didn't even say anything about like, this is urgent.
22:28 - Laura: He didn't articulate that at all.
22:29 - Laura: But I did it because I knew that it was.
22:31 - Laura: And it was like we were missing the country field, which would prevent
validation so they can't run scoring.
22:37 - Laura: And it was like a 15 minute kind of fix.
22:40 - Laura: So there's things like that where I do also use my judgment because a lot of
the times your users can't articulate.
22:50 - Laura: But I can send that out as well.
22:51 - Laura: And if you like disagree and you wanna like talk about what is for you must
do versus not, like you and I can come up with some rules around that as well, so that I can
make decisions quickly.
23:05 - Laura: Otherwise, I feel like I am usually pretty good at judging, like this is something
that we should fix versus not.
23:13 - Laura: Okay, so yeah, we'll be going through all of the ones that haven't been
completed that are in new or backlog that have been created recently.
23:20 - Laura: We'll be going through those on the steering committee and I'll go through and
make sure they're tagged and stuff.
23:25 - Laura: And then these ones, so we've got the data duplicate maintenance prevention.
23:30 - Laura: So I started creating like the epic for the plotty tool and like creating the
duplicate jobs and all that kind of stuff.
23:37 - Laura: So I'm starting to create those as well.
23:41 - Laura: One I will ask about prior to the steering, Juan called this one out.
23:48 - Laura: I think this is like a nice to have.
23:51 - Laura: Sorry, it's not a nice to have.
23:53 - Laura: It's just that there's a workaround.
23:57 - Laura: my question isn't necessarily about the work itself.
24:00 - Laura: It's more about who should do it.
24:02 - Laura: So this is another conga.
24:06 - Laura: So basically the California, they want to update some of your conga templates
to reflect some of the rules that we have for Texas.
24:16 - Laura: So it's not really anything sales for C.
24:20 - Laura: I think it's almost like we might want to designate somebody like a J who
knows Konga and knows how to create templates and then have him do that.
24:33 - Laura: And then all he needs to do is kind of like, give me the Ids.
24:38 - Laura: So I don't know if that
24:43 - Laura: wait, actually, sorry, hang on.
24:44 - Laura: He did create them.
24:48 - Laura: Nevermind.
24:48 - Laura: You know what?
24:49 - Laura: Just ignore the last minute.
24:50 - Laura: This is a me thing.
24:51 - Laura: I lied.
24:52 - Laura: I'm sorry.
24:53 - Laura: We're good.
24:54 - Michael Kianmahd: All right.
24:55 - Laura: Yeah, it's been a busy week.
24:59 - Laura: Okay, I think that's all that I wanted to show you.
25:04 - Laura: Do you have any questions?
25:06 - Laura: Do you have anything that you wanted to run through?
25:11 - Michael Kianmahd: I feel like we should do it on Monday.
25:14 - Laura: Yeah.
25:14 - Michael Kianmahd: Do you feel more in balance with everything?
25:18 - Laura: Yeah.
25:19 - Laura: Okay, good.
25:20 - Laura: I do.
25:22 - Laura: Yesterday's conversation was really helpful for me.
25:27 - Laura: Actually, the last two calls that we've had, like the contact roles and then the
one like just around all the scoring and stuff, that's really helpful.
25:37 - Laura: And I feel like it's probably like it's needed.
25:43 - Laura: That being said, it's not a small change either.
25:46 - Laura: So like even if we create our like state, it'll make it a lot easier to like draw a
path to get there.
25:53 - Laura: But I'm just giving you like a heads up.
25:56 - Laura: It's not going to be something we're going to be able to like do overnight.
26:01 - Michael Kianmahd: So I understand.
26:03 - Michael Kianmahd: Maybe it'll take two nights.
26:07 - Laura: You're hilarious.
26:10 - Michael Kianmahd: I just sent you a link.
26:13 - Michael Kianmahd: You saw it.
26:15 - Laura: I see the link.
26:15 - Laura: Yeah.
26:16 - Michael Kianmahd: No.
26:20 - Michael Kianmahd: He founded Airbnb, but he was a designer.
26:25 - Laura: Oh, I read a book, not this one, I read a book about entrepreneurs and one of
the stories was Airbnb.
26:33 - Laura: It's such a cool story.
26:34 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah, they're really interesting people.
26:36 - Michael Kianmahd: I feel like this guy gives me major Steve Jobs vibes.
26:41 - Laura: Yeah.
26:42 - Michael Kianmahd: I think you should watch this.
26:45 - Laura: Okay.
26:46 - Michael Kianmahd: There's a lot about what he said not everything.
26:49 - Michael Kianmahd: I'm not comparing myself in any way
26:50 - Michael Kianmahd: I'm like is less than 1% of what this guy has done
26:54 - Michael Kianmahd: in the amount of time that he's been alive, but
26:57 - Michael Kianmahd: It's very inspiring what he's done and how he thinks about it
27:02 - Michael Kianmahd: And I think like it's this thing that he talks about called founder
mode, okay, I think part of
27:13 - Michael Kianmahd: Part of what has been helpful I think
27:16 - Michael Kianmahd: is also what's been a challenge for me personally
27:20 - Michael Kianmahd: which is like my increasing involvement.
27:23 - Michael Kianmahd: Because what I've noticed is like, some people don't fully under-
stand or appreciate the nuance of what you're asking for.
27:31 - Michael Kianmahd: And it's similar to what we talked about at lunch, you know, like
the why, not just the what or the how.
27:36 - Laura: Yep.
27:37 - Michael Kianmahd: So I'm like trying to be a lot more intentional about being involved
in these types of discussions.
27:42 - Michael Kianmahd: So like when you feel like you should cue me in, feel free to cue
me in.
27:47 - Michael Kianmahd: Don't like, don't feel like you need to protect my time.
27:50 - Laura: No, yeah, having you on the calls, the last couple calls are, you can see where
your users are getting stuck on like certain, the way that you used to do it or the way that's
always been done.
28:03 - Laura: So you just providing that like, hey guys, reset is really, really helpful.
28:07 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah.
28:08 - Michael Kianmahd: 100%.
28:09 - Michael Kianmahd: I could see you getting off track or you being like, going in the
wrong direction because of the feedback you're getting.
28:16 - Michael Kianmahd: And then if I'm not there to intervene
28:18 - Michael Kianmahd: I worry that it's gonna be a burning time
28:20 - Michael Kianmahd: and you're gonna be overwhelmed with like
28:23 - Michael Kianmahd: like as soon as I hear like, well, Bl does it this way
28:26 - Michael Kianmahd: that's like a strong warning or Tr does it this way
28:29 - Michael Kianmahd: or like we're already still talking about the past
28:32 - Michael Kianmahd: and we should be talking about the future
28:33 - Michael Kianmahd: and most of the conversations we're talking about.
28:35 - Michael Kianmahd: So I had a meeting yesterday and I was like, when we talk about
this stuff, we're talking about an end state.
28:42 - Michael Kianmahd: We're not talking about how it is done or how it was done.
28:45 - Michael Kianmahd: We're talking about how it should be done.
28:47 - Laura: Yes, I agree.
28:48 - Laura: There's a lot of people who are set in their ways in your work, and that's not
necessarily a bad thing.
28:55 - Laura: It's just that I can see it.
28:57 - Laura: I ended up creating a ticket for training just because with dealing with Juan
around Aio, it wasn't like testing.
29:05 - Laura: It was literally just changing the way that he thinks completely.
29:09 - Laura: And he just kept going back to, well, where do I find this?
29:11 - Laura: And I said, okay, well, but you're not gonna be using, like you're not using your
inbox anymore, right?
29:16 - Laura: You're using Salesforce.
29:18 - Laura: Like here's the dashboard, it gives you all the data.
29:20 - Laura: But I want that, no, like it's changing the behaviors a lot as well as like changing
the system.
29:29 - Laura: So yeah, I will bring you in.
29:32 - Laura: I'll definitely bring you in.
29:33 - Laura: But I feel like I'm pretty used to this kind of stuff.
29:37 - Laura: Changing the behavior is like one of the things that I've had to deal with like
always.
29:42 - Laura: And I'm pretty comfortable doing that.
29:45 - Michael Kianmahd: Well, it makes one of us.
29:47 - Michael Kianmahd: That's good.
29:50 - Michael Kianmahd: I'm also comfortable and I think we're, I could be wrong or I could
be fooling myself or whatever, but I feel like we're at, I think people are starting to change how
they're thinking about it a bit.
30:03 - Michael Kianmahd: I think they see the light, which is very different than how I think
we collectively felt two months ago or three months ago.
30:08 - Laura: I agree.
30:09 - Laura: Yeah.
30:10 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah.
30:10 - Michael Kianmahd: Just lean into that really hard and make sure we not lose it.
30:14 - Laura: Doing my best.
30:15 - Michael Kianmahd: I'm sure it's correlated with your visit.
30:17 - Michael Kianmahd: So if you want to come back.
30:19 - Laura: I can.
30:20 - Laura: Yeah, I have to get a new passport.
30:22 - Laura: Actually, I'll be going to Dreamforce again in but that's not until October.
30:27 - Laura: But like, in between June and October, I have to get my passport renewed.
30:33 - Laura: So if you want to like either squeeze it in one of those sides, getting quick
because I don't know how long I think they'll probably take a couple months.
30:41 - Michael Kianmahd: I think you realize the value is so valuable.
30:46 - Laura: Yeah.
30:46 - Michael Kianmahd: If you want to, if you want to do it sooner rather than later, I'm
okay with it.
30:50 - Laura: Okay.
30:51 - Michael Kianmahd: But you tell me I'm just offering.
30:54 - Laura: Okay.
30:54 - Laura: I appreciate that.
30:56 - Laura: I definitely like, you know, me, I don't hold back.
30:58 - Laura: I'll let you know.
30:59 - Laura: My blog is coming on site and you're paying for it.
31:01 - Laura: But yeah, it is really valuable just to like spend that time and like build the
relationships because yeah, now nobody hesitates to chat and just chat me all day long.
31:14 - Michael Kianmahd: Good.
31:15 - Michael Kianmahd: Thank you.
31:16 - Laura: Okay, thanks.
31:17 - Laura: Enjoy the rest of your day.
31:18 - Michael Kianmahd: All right, get that passport.
31:20 - Laura: Yeah.
31:21 - Laura: Oh no, Nashville first.
31:22 - Laura: Nashville's end of the month and then I'll get it renewed.
31:56 - Laura: Michael Kianmahd, Laura, Chorus Notetaker
32:25 - Michael Kianmahd: to an Apple store and you should try it.
32:28 - Laura: Yeah.
32:29 - Michael Kianmahd: Like it's literally that experience.
32:33 - Michael Kianmahd: It's what you just described.
32:34 - Michael Kianmahd: Like Alicia Keys saying to me, so.
32:38 - Laura: Did she say Michael and?
32:40 - Michael Kianmahd: I don't know, I did a little too weird, but.
32:44 - Laura: That's probably coming next.
32:46 - Laura: Yeah, Paul has tried it and he said it's really trippy.
32:51 - Laura: I should, well then I could just stay home, put on my Apple Vision and not need
to go anywhere.
32:57 - Michael Kianmahd: I'm not down with that, but.
32:59 - Laura: Neither am I, that's why I'm like, nah.
33:02 - Laura: I still went to the library until Covid, before Covid.
33:06 - Laura: I was one of those people, I refused to get a tablet because I'm like, I need an
actual book.
33:13 - Laura: Yeah.
33:14 - Michael Kianmahd: It's pretty cool.
33:15 - Laura: Yeah.
33:15 - Laura: What I do in my personal life is very different than what I do for work and vice
versa.
33:21 - Michael Kianmahd: I'm the same way.
33:22 - Laura: Yeah, Ok, well cool.
33:24 - Laura: Good to know.
33:24 - Laura: But yeah, Nashville then passport and then I'll come visit.
33:28 - Michael Kianmahd: Ok bye thanks.
