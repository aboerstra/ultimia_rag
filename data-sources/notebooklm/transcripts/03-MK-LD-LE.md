00:00 - Laura Dolphin: Good
00:01 - Michael Kianmahd: afternoon.
00:04 - Michael Kianmahd: How are you
00:06 - Laura Dolphin: doing?
00:06 - Laura Dolphin: Good.
00:07 - Laura Dolphin: How are you?
00:09 - Laura Dolphin: Give Linda a minute.
00:25 - Laura Dolphin: Hey Charles.
00:28 - Charles Salanga: Yes.
00:35 - Michael Kianmahd: Laura, while everybody's popping on, would you mind pulling up
that email I just sent to...
00:40 - Michael Kianmahd: To Ken.
00:43 - Laura Dolphin: I have not looked at emails in a few hours, but let me go have a look.
00:47 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
00:47 - Michael Kianmahd: Okay.
00:48 - Michael Kianmahd: We could do it.
00:49 - Michael Kianmahd: We could do it at the tail end of the conversation since I think
everybody's on.
00:55 - Charles Salanga: Oh, okay.
00:55 - Charles Salanga: Just a quick heads up.
00:56 - Charles Salanga: I have a hard stop at 1045.
00:57 - Charles Salanga: I have physical therapy.
00:59 - Charles Salanga: So like if you guys have any questions.
01:00 - Charles Salanga: For me, I can answer them right off the bat, but I have to get out
of here.
01:04 - Charles Salanga: by 1045.
01:07 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah, no worries.
01:09 - Laura Dolphin: So Juan and Charles, were you on the meeting already or did Lyndon
forward it to you for the UCC discussion?
01:17 - jguevara: Okay.
01:19 - Laura Dolphin: So should we start there?
01:20 - Laura Dolphin: Because.
01:21 - Laura Dolphin: um charles does have a heart like he's gonna drop at 10 45 do you
want to start talking about that
01:26 - Laura Dolphin: That topic can go.
01:28 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
01:28 - Laura Dolphin: Okay.
01:31 - Lyndon: Yeah, so as we were going through...
01:35 - Lyndon: the discussions related to the recent set of
01:40 - Lyndon: changes.
01:42 - Lyndon: We think we uncovered an incremental
01:51 - Lyndon: I think that the way the UCC filing has been
01:56 - Lyndon: structured up to this point is that our operating assumption is that
02:01 - Lyndon: The collateral is either titled or non-titled.
02:06 - Lyndon: But what we discussed is...
02:09 - Lyndon: having a UCC filing at the opportunity level.
02:12 - Lyndon: So that would be a change to how we're approaching this.
02:15 - Lyndon: And so we wanted to talk through.
02:18 - Lyndon: how extensive would this change be and then also having the parties on the
call so we can talk
02:22 - Lyndon: Are there any unique circumstances?
02:27 - Laura Dolphin: Not really sure I understand what you mean by a change.
02:29 - Laura Dolphin: There's nothing that you said that is different from how it is today.
02:32 - Laura Dolphin: So maybe you could say it in a different way or just.
02:37 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
02:39 - Lyndon: I'm learning your communication style, Laura.
02:41 - Lyndon: So.
02:41 - Lyndon: So, yeah, let me take another run at this.
02:44 - Lyndon: My understanding, Michael shared that.
02:47 - Lyndon: Yeah, the way the UCC filing would be addressed today.
02:50 - Lyndon: So we don't have a separate.
02:54 - Lyndon: today at the collateral level.
02:56 - Lyndon: We have
02:58 - Lyndon: As part of the design, we identify that there's either collateral will be titled.
03:02 - Lyndon: or non-titled.
03:04 - Lyndon: This would be a separate category for
03:07 - Lyndon: the UCC filing.
03:10 - Lyndon: However, it wouldn't be at the collateral level.
03:13 - Lyndon: So our requirement would be to add the ability to identify.
03:19 - Lyndon: the UCC filing status at the opportunity level.
03:22 - Laura Dolphin: Charles, how do you identify that today?
03:27 - Charles Salanga: It was a field that I added in the vehicle section because when we
started
03:31 - Charles Salanga: you know, mixing in all our notes.
03:33 - Charles Salanga: I added a field within
03:35 - Charles Salanga: The vehicle called UCC filing.
03:38 - Charles Salanga: So anything non-titled doesn't require.
03:41 - Charles Salanga: a trip to the DMV or anything like that.
03:42 - Charles Salanga: You don't need to have pending receipt or original receipt.
03:45 - Charles Salanga: It's just
03:46 - Charles Salanga: straight UCC filing.
03:48 - Michael Kianmahd: Charles, did you add a dropdown item?
03:51 - Charles Salanga: It's a drop down.
03:52 - Charles Salanga: I'm sorry.
03:52 - Charles Salanga: A drop down.
03:53 - Charles Salanga: A drop
03:53 - Michael Kianmahd: down.
03:54 - Laura Dolphin: On vehicles?
03:55 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah.
03:56 - Charles Salanga: Vehicles.
03:56 - Charles Salanga: Right.
03:57 - Laura Dolphin: Okay.
03:58 - Laura Dolphin: So, sorry, from what you just said, it sounded like you said.
04:02 - Laura Dolphin: only titled vehicles require UCC filing.
04:05 - Laura Dolphin: That's what I heard.
04:07 - Charles Salanga: Only non-titled require UCC files.
04:10 - Charles Salanga: Yeah.
04:11 - Laura Dolphin: So in the new data model, we will be able to identify titled versus
non-titled.
04:17 - Laura Dolphin: So on an opportunity, if you have a non-titled piece of collateral, you
will have to have a use.
04:22 - Laura Dolphin: C filing.
04:23 - Laura Dolphin: Is that correct?
04:24 - Charles Salanga: But here's my thing.
04:25 - Charles Salanga: When we're unifying and we're going to have a new set of...
04:28 - Charles Salanga: Docs, we're going to have a UCC filing on everything.
04:32 - Charles Salanga: Not just non-title.
04:34 - Lyndon: Hey,
04:35 - Charles Salanga: I
04:36 - Lyndon: was thinking about that.
04:37 - Lyndon: aspect of it.
04:39 - Lyndon: Is that going to be, you know, outside of market norms?
04:43 - Lyndon: Right.
04:43 - Michael Kianmahd: Is
04:44 - Lyndon: that gonna,
04:45 - Charles Salanga: no, um, I've had, um,
04:48 - Charles Salanga: I've had conversations where a UCC filing is actually the standard
for a commercial loan.
04:52 - Charles Salanga: Like we should be filing UCCs on everything.
04:55 - Charles Salanga: and
04:55 - Lyndon: it gives us more of
04:55 - Charles Salanga: a...
04:55 - Lyndon: RUN!
04:57 - Charles Salanga: Even with trucking.
04:58 - Charles Salanga: Okay.
04:59 - Charles Salanga: Yeah, they do ask that, yeah.
05:03 - Charles Salanga: It gives us more of a competitive edge.
05:06 - Michael Kianmahd: So on the topic of Laura's communication style.
05:10 - Michael Kianmahd: She communicates also with her eyes.
05:13 - Michael Kianmahd: I've learned the hard way.
05:16 - Michael Kianmahd: So I've also learned Charles's communication styles and I also
have my own shortcomings.
05:22 - Laura Dolphin: so
05:23 - Michael Kianmahd: I gotta be super specific about this because you know
05:28 - Michael Kianmahd: We're all, you know, different, I guess.
05:30 - Michael Kianmahd: So.
05:32 - Michael Kianmahd: Title status.
05:35 - Laura Dolphin: Is that
05:36 - Michael Kianmahd: it?
05:36 - Michael Kianmahd: Yep.
05:38 - Charles Salanga: So click there.
05:39 - Michael Kianmahd: Drop
05:39 - Charles Salanga: down.
05:39 - Charles Salanga: So I added UC.
05:41 - Michael Kianmahd: Hold on, Charles.
05:41 - Michael Kianmahd: Hold on.
05:42 - Charles Salanga: Okay.
05:43 - Michael Kianmahd: Title status.
05:44 - Michael Kianmahd: pending original.
05:47 - Michael Kianmahd: Charles added UCC filing.
05:51 - Michael Kianmahd: Bad, bad, bad data.
05:53 - Michael Kianmahd: Bad data.
05:55 - Michael Kianmahd: Why is this bad data?
05:56 - Michael Kianmahd: It's bad data because it's not a title.
06:00 - Laura Dolphin: It's
06:00 - Michael Kianmahd: a hacked way of identifying who has a UCC filing.
06:05 - Michael Kianmahd: Another reason why it's bad is the UCC filing happens
06:09 - Michael Kianmahd: At the company level, not at the specific collateral level.
06:15 - Michael Kianmahd: So when you file a UCC filing, you may name specific collateral,
but it happens at the entity level of the company.
06:23 - Laura Dolphin: Do you need to file?
06:25 - Laura Dolphin: So if you have three deals over the course of a lifetime with a company,
do you need to file?
06:29 - Laura Dolphin: file three times or just once
06:31 - Michael Kianmahd: you should file three and you should have cross default
06:34 - Michael Kianmahd: cross-collateralized language but once you have a blanket lean
like normally the way
06:39 - Michael Kianmahd: We file it, it references an equipment finance agreement number
or.
06:43 - Michael Kianmahd: I'm not sure we do it for leases, do we Charles?
06:48 - Michael Kianmahd: I think you're also fine.
06:50 - Charles Salanga: We do too, but we mentioned specifically that it's for a commercial
lease.
06:54 - Charles Salanga: Not in EFA.
06:55 - Charles Salanga: We have language for that too.
06:56 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah.
06:57 - Michael Kianmahd: And then if you do a subsequent deal, you file a second UCC filing
and there's cross-default, cross-collateralized language.
07:02 - Michael Kianmahd: which and you reference both efas or both leases right
07:06 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah.
07:07 - Michael Kianmahd: So it's, it's a, yeah.
07:10 - Michael Kianmahd: Does that answer your question?
07:13 - Laura Dolphin: Me?
07:13 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah, so I understand what a UCC filing is.
07:16 - Laura Dolphin: I understand.
07:17 - Laura Dolphin: to which object it ties to.
07:19 - Laura Dolphin: Like anytime you have an opportunity or a deal, you run a UCC filing.
07:25 - Laura Dolphin: What I don't understand is what is the.
07:28 - Laura Dolphin: the problem that you're trying to solve.
07:32 - Laura Dolphin: And then you get a model.
07:33 - Laura Dolphin: So we are like.
07:35 - Laura Dolphin: Or it sounds like you're going to run it on every opportunity.
07:39 - Laura Dolphin: That's what you just said.
07:40 - Laura Dolphin: Is that correct?
07:42 - Michael Kianmahd: Well, there's a few, few types of things we're solving.
07:45 - Michael Kianmahd: So.
07:46 - Michael Kianmahd: I'll be really macro and then we'll move into being specific.
07:52 - Michael Kianmahd: So macro, we are trying to unify business processes.
07:58 - Michael Kianmahd: One thing today we are not tracking in Salesforce properly or
clearly.
08:02 - Michael Kianmahd: cleanly is whether UCC filings are filed.
08:08 - Michael Kianmahd: We're also not tracking when those UCC filings.
08:12 - Michael Kianmahd: which expire five years out.
08:15 - Michael Kianmahd: We're not tracking that in Salesforce in any way.
08:17 - Michael Kianmahd: So that's a second problem we can solve.
08:21 - Michael Kianmahd: Third is terminations.
08:23 - Michael Kianmahd: There is no...
08:23 - Michael Kianmahd: tracking of terminations of those UCC filings.
08:27 - Laura Dolphin: What is a termination?
08:29 - Michael Kianmahd: Like when your loan gets paid off?
08:31 - Lyndon: Expiration?
08:32 - Lyndon: or termination
08:33 - Michael Kianmahd: expiration and termination
08:37 - Michael Kianmahd: and then expire.
08:39 - Michael Kianmahd: So if they expire inside of the loan term, they need to be renewed.
08:44 - Michael Kianmahd: which is why tracking expirations matters.
08:48 - Michael Kianmahd: because we have to decide if we want to renew or not, if they
expire outside of when the loan
08:54 - Michael Kianmahd: is paid off.
08:56 - Michael Kianmahd: then we have to legally terminate the UCC filing.
09:01 - Laura Dolphin: And if you terminate a UCC filing, does that terminate?
09:05 - Laura Dolphin: The loan?
09:06 - Michael Kianmahd: Terminates the lien.
09:08 - Laura Dolphin: The lien, yeah.
09:12 - Laura Dolphin: Okay.
09:14 - Michael Kianmahd: A loan is different than...
09:17 - Michael Kianmahd: a lien, right?
09:20 - Michael Kianmahd: So a lien is what?
09:21 - Michael Kianmahd: gives you like a priority position on the assets of the business
09:26 - Michael Kianmahd: And the way to do that on a company is you file a UCC filing.
09:32 - Michael Kianmahd: The way to do that on a vehicle is you get a vehicle title.
09:36 - Michael Kianmahd: And the way to do that on real estate is you get a mortgage or a
deed of trust.
09:40 - Laura Dolphin: So if something gets terminated or expired, what does that translate
to?
09:46 - Laura Dolphin: In terms of the deal, like, does it mean like, could you ever have a UCC
filing?
09:51 - Laura Dolphin: expire or terminate before the deal has been closed one
09:55 - Michael Kianmahd: You could.
09:56 - Laura Dolphin: Okay.
09:56 - Laura Dolphin: So if it gets
09:58 - Michael Kianmahd: terminated.
09:59 - Michael Kianmahd: Sorry, before close one or before the lump.
10:02 - Laura Dolphin: Before you fund it.
10:04 - Michael Kianmahd: You file
10:04 - Charles Salanga: it before
10:05 - Michael Kianmahd: you fund it.
10:06 - Laura Dolphin: You file it when you
10:08 - Michael Kianmahd: fund it?
10:08 - Michael Kianmahd: You file it before you fund it, like the day before or like a couple
days before.
10:13 - Laura Dolphin: So if it gets turned down, like if a UCC filing comes back and they say...
10:19 - Laura Dolphin: no
10:20 - Michael Kianmahd: they don't do that that doesn't happen
10:22 - Laura Dolphin: okay so there's no situation where
10:25 - Laura Dolphin: it's going like a UCC filing status or outcome is going to make a deal.
10:32 - Laura Dolphin: go to lost instead of funded.
10:34 - Laura Dolphin: Is that correct?
10:37 - Michael Kianmahd: you could file a UCC and then the deal doesn't work.
10:41 - Michael Kianmahd: out and then you would have to market close loss and then you
would terminate the UCC filing.
10:47 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah, but it doesn't work the other way around.
10:49 - Michael Kianmahd: What
10:50 - Lyndon: would the UCC filing would not?
10:51 - Lyndon: trigger closed loss
10:54 - Laura Dolphin: that's
10:54 - Lyndon: what she's asking from a workflow standpoint
10:58 - Michael Kianmahd: No.
10:58 - Laura Dolphin: Okay.
10:59 - Lyndon: Yeah.
10:59 - Lyndon: It's
10:59 - Laura Dolphin: just like kind of yes, no answers.
11:01 - Laura Dolphin: It doesn't need to go for it.
11:02 - Laura Dolphin: You see where I'm going with this.
11:03 - Lyndon: But hold on, like, so if we're unable to secure UCC filing.
11:09 - Lyndon: would we walk away from a deal?
11:14 - Michael Kianmahd: It's not a yes or no question because UCC filings.
11:21 - Michael Kianmahd: are done for purchase money purposes.
11:24 - Michael Kianmahd: They're also done for blanket lien purposes.
11:27 - Michael Kianmahd: So if the intention is to finance a purchase money equipment
acquisition.
11:32 - Michael Kianmahd: and there's an existing blanket lien, that should not deter us so
long as we don't need additional collateral.
11:39 - Michael Kianmahd: However,
11:41 - Michael Kianmahd: However, if we're financing something and there are assets at
the business,
11:46 - Michael Kianmahd: that we need to be first lean priority position on from a UCC
standpoint.
11:50 - Michael Kianmahd: And we do a UCC.
11:50 - Michael Kianmahd: the search before we do a UCC filing and we identify open UCC
filings.
11:57 - Michael Kianmahd: that would prevent us from encumbering the assets of the
business with a first lien.
12:02 - Michael Kianmahd: then it could kill the deal.
12:06 - Michael Kianmahd: So you do a UC.
12:07 - Lyndon: But not necessarily.
12:09 - Michael Kianmahd: But not necessarily, yeah.
12:14 - Michael Kianmahd: you know, funding manager and credit manager, because if we
can't get perfected interest in the collateral that we're financing.
12:23 - Michael Kianmahd: then it's probably something that we should probably shy away
from.
12:28 - Laura Dolphin: Okay, so.
12:31 - Laura Dolphin: Okay, that all makes sense.
12:34 - Laura Dolphin: I'm still struggling.
12:36 - Laura Dolphin: Whoever found...
12:38 - Laura Dolphin: What I'm trying to understand is like walk me through what you saw
12:42 - Laura Dolphin: Or what you were going through in like the new data model that
caused you to say, this is not going to allow us to file UCC.
12:49 - Laura Dolphin: the filings in a way that we want to because everything i'm hearing
12:54 - Laura Dolphin: is
12:57 - Laura Dolphin: potentially possible.
12:58 - Laura Dolphin: I'm just trying to hone in on like, what are you actually asking for?
13:02 - Laura Dolphin: What's your requirement?
13:06 - Laura Dolphin: So.
13:06 - Laura Dolphin: So.
13:08 - Michael Kianmahd: Like what's like, how do we want it to look?
13:11 - Laura Dolphin: No.
13:11 - Laura Dolphin: So, so it sounds
13:12 - Lyndon: like you
13:13 - Laura Dolphin: just need to be able to.
13:14 - Laura Dolphin: you on an opportunity just like you create a contract or whatever
you're going to generate something that is a ucc filing record
13:23 - Laura Dolphin: and it relates to non-titled collateral but what is the requirement like
you
13:27 - Lyndon: only
13:28 - Laura Dolphin: but
13:28 - Lyndon: yeah
13:29 - Laura Dolphin: if there's a non-titled collateral what's the requirement
13:33 - Lyndon: No, we want the requirements to be able to track UCC filing at the opportunity
level.
13:40 - Lyndon: with an expiration date.
13:44 - Laura Dolphin: And a status.
13:45 - Lyndon: I don't think.
13:47 - Laura Dolphin: Approved, yeah.
13:49 - Lyndon: Yeah, I don't think we need like separate set of notes.
13:52 - Lyndon: Just tracking on that.
13:58 - Lyndon: Ideally, that would drive workflow.
14:00 - Lyndon: in the future.
14:02 - Lyndon: What we talked about was having the titles team.
14:05 - Lyndon: monitor UCC filings and handle renewals of them.
14:10 - Lyndon: So that's...
14:13 - Lyndon: That's essentially it.
14:14 - Lyndon: I don't think, based on what we've discussed, I don't think there's any other
workflow requirements at this time.
14:19 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
14:20 - Laura Dolphin: Okay.
14:20 - Laura Dolphin: That's what it sounded like you were wanting.
14:21 - Laura Dolphin: I just wanted someone to verbally say it.
14:23 - Laura Dolphin: So does it, do you need to be able to relate the UCC filing?
14:26 - Laura Dolphin: Cause the parent would be the opportunity.
14:29 - Laura Dolphin: Do you need to be able to say, like, for example, there's an opportunity
and there's a titled and a non-titled collateral?
14:35 - Laura Dolphin: Do you want to specify on that UCC filing one?
14:40 - Laura Dolphin: of the collateral or both of the collateral or do we always just assume
that if an opportunity has
14:46 - Laura Dolphin: X amount of collateral that the UCC filing is for all of them.
14:51 - Laura Dolphin: Is that questioning?
14:52 - Lyndon: I think the UCC filing is by definition for all of them.
14:57 - Lyndon: Irregardless
14:58 - Laura Dolphin: of whether it's a pledged or purchased piece of collateral?
15:04 - Lyndon: I don't know the answer to that.
15:06 - Lyndon: Charles or Michael?
15:08 - Michael Kianmahd: What's the question, Laura?
15:10 - Laura Dolphin: Do you file UCC filings on collateral that are
15:13 - Laura Dolphin: pledged not purchased
15:17 - Michael Kianmahd: Yes.
15:19 - Laura Dolphin: Okay.
15:19 - Laura Dolphin: So all the collateral and an opportunity relates back to the UCC file.
15:25 - Laura Dolphin: Regardless, there's no criteria on a collateral.
15:28 - Laura Dolphin: Like a collateral could be other.
15:29 - Laura Dolphin: Could be gym equipment, could be whatever it is, and we file UCC
filing on it, correct?
15:33 - Michael Kianmahd: As long as it's non-titled.
15:36 - Laura Dolphin: There's the criteria.
15:37 - Laura Dolphin: So we only file UCC filings on non-titled collateral.
15:43 - Charles Salanga: Michael, because when we finalize our docs for both...
15:48 - Charles Salanga: Departments or unifying the docs, we're going to start filing UCCs
on everything.
15:52 - Charles Salanga: That would give us leverage.
15:53 - Charles Salanga: on every single business that
15:55 - Michael Kianmahd: what i'm saying what i'm saying is very legal and nuanced so like
15:59 - Michael Kianmahd: Let me just be very specific about it.
16:01 - Michael Kianmahd: So you can file a UCC.
16:03 - Michael Kianmahd: D lean, that's a blanket lean, and it would encumber everything
at the entity level.
16:10 - Michael Kianmahd: So inventory, receivables, any non-titled equipment.
16:14 - Michael Kianmahd: furniture, whatever, future claims, future receivables, future
inventory.
16:20 - Michael Kianmahd: whatever so that's what it encumbers what would be excluded
from that filing
16:25 - Michael Kianmahd: would be titled equipment.
16:27 - Michael Kianmahd: You need a title to...
16:29 - Michael Kianmahd: to fully secure yourself on titled assets.
16:33 - Michael Kianmahd: and real estate.
16:35 - Michael Kianmahd: So there's like a higher bar for titled equipment and a higher bar
for real estate.
16:40 - Michael Kianmahd: So what we're saying, going back to requirements, is
16:44 - Michael Kianmahd: going forward, we want to file UCC filings.
16:48 - Michael Kianmahd: across every borrower, lessee, and guarantor.
16:54 - Michael Kianmahd: of our accounts.
16:56 - Michael Kianmahd: That's what we want to do.
16:58 - Michael Kianmahd: That's what we do, right, Charles?
17:01 - Charles Salanga: Correct.
17:02 - Charles Salanga: That's what I do.
17:04 - Laura Dolphin: On non-titled or other collateral elements.
17:06 - Michael Kianmahd: On all borrowers and all LCCs, we will be filing UCC filing.
17:12 - Michael Kianmahd: Thanks.
17:14 - Laura Dolphin: On only non-titled or
17:16 - Michael Kianmahd: other.
17:18 - Michael Kianmahd: No, on the entity.
17:20 - Michael Kianmahd: So on.
17:22 - Laura Dolphin: So it has nothing to do with the collateral.
17:24 - Laura Dolphin: You don't care to like associate it to say that.
17:26 - Laura Dolphin: the UCC filing relates back to this?
17:30 - Laura Dolphin: The answer can simply be no.
17:32 - Laura Dolphin: if it has nothing to do with the collateral.
17:36 - Laura Dolphin: The reason I'm asking is because
17:38 - Michael Kianmahd: they're not salesforce purposes, I guess.
17:40 - Michael Kianmahd: Right.
17:43 - Lyndon: From a data model standpoint, you don't need to link the UCC filing to
collateral.
17:48 - Laura Dolphin: Perfect.
17:48 - Laura Dolphin: That's all.
17:49 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
17:49 - Laura Dolphin: So we want to relate it back to like.
17:52 - Laura Dolphin: caught like entities so debtors and lessees the entities that are online
yep
17:59 - Charles Salanga: Okay.
17:59 - Charles Salanga: I'm going to sign off.
18:00 - Charles Salanga: I'll have a good one,
18:01 - Laura Dolphin: guys.
18:02 - Lyndon: Thanks, Charles.
18:02 - Charles Salanga: Take care.
18:10 - Michael Kianmahd: So
18:12 - Michael Kianmahd: In terms of like...
18:15 - Michael Kianmahd: where this is documented.
18:18 - Michael Kianmahd: My thought is it's done at the opportunity level.
18:24 - Michael Kianmahd: We look for UCC filing date.
18:28 - Michael Kianmahd: UCC expiration date, UCC termination date.
18:34 - Michael Kianmahd: Notes.
18:38 - Michael Kianmahd: And then my question for you would be.
18:42 - Michael Kianmahd: What do we do when we are also filing on guarantors and
guaranteeing entities?
18:47 - Michael Kianmahd: warm body guarantees and other entities where's that done
because that those
18:53 - Michael Kianmahd: Those are related contacts or related accounts.
18:58 - Michael Kianmahd: Where do those get documented?
19:00 - Laura Dolphin: Do you need one UCC filing for?
19:03 - Laura Dolphin: Each different entity or just one per deal.
19:08 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah, one per entity, including people.
19:13 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
19:13 - Laura Dolphin: Well, so the account is just the contact.
19:18 - Laura Dolphin: That's their entity.
19:19 - Laura Dolphin: So you would have on an opportunity, you would have UCC filings and
the parent of that UCC filing.
19:25 - Laura Dolphin: It's actually a contact, which are your guarantors or your debtors, and
they relate back to the opportunity so that you can see all the UCC filings.
19:33 - Laura Dolphin: If you have Jane Doe and John Smith, Jane's your debtor and John's
your guarantor, you're going to have
19:38 - Laura Dolphin: Two UCC filings, both for that deal, but one's for Jaina, one's for John.
19:44 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah.
19:44 - Laura Dolphin: And that entity ABC, that's a natural relationship.
19:47 - Laura Dolphin: It'll just show.
19:48 - Laura Dolphin: and then John works at he owns I don't know John Smith Trucking
that's the entity it'll just show
19:54 - Laura Dolphin: So that relationship is inherited.
19:59 - Michael Kianmahd: Okay.
19:59 - Michael Kianmahd: So like for tracking purposes, like let's say we do a deal, it's ABC
trucking.
20:06 - Michael Kianmahd: and it's owned by John and Larry.
20:10 - Michael Kianmahd: We'll be filing three UCC filings.
20:13 - Michael Kianmahd: One on ABC Trucking, one on John, one on Larry.
20:20 - Michael Kianmahd: At the opportunity level of ABC Trucking, will we be able to see
all three filings?
20:28 - Laura Dolphin: So if you file it on ABC tracking, do you associate a contact at all?
20:36 - Michael Kianmahd: On the UCC filing itself.
20:39 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
20:41 - Michael Kianmahd: No.
20:44 - Michael Kianmahd: Okay.
20:45 - Michael Kianmahd: Detail is reference of an EFA or a lease.
20:51 - Michael Kianmahd: But I think what we're talking about is how to track it in Sales-
force.
20:55 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah, I understand.
20:56 - Laura Dolphin: If the deal is for an individual.
21:01 - Laura Dolphin: and you have, let's say you have like the individual debtor and then
you have a guarantor.
21:07 - Laura Dolphin: You would only have two UCC filings, correct?
21:14 - Michael Kianmahd: Technically one, because the guarantor and individual is one and
the same.
21:22 - Laura Dolphin: Okay, well, maybe that's just not a scenario.
21:24 - Laura Dolphin: I was envisioning if you had like an individual and then you had like
another person.
21:27 - Laura Dolphin: personal guarantor i don't know if that would come up but
21:30 - Michael Kianmahd: yeah then you would have two
21:32 - Laura Dolphin: yeah
21:32 - Laura Dolphin: Okay.
21:33 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
21:33 - Laura Dolphin: Okay.
21:35 - Laura Dolphin: Let me think about how you'd handle the business versus the
company.
21:38 - Laura Dolphin: contacts relationship um it's all doable you can it's
21:44 - Laura Dolphin: Pretty straightforward.
21:45 - Laura Dolphin: It's just an additional object where we would create some relation-
ships to opportunities, contacts and accounts.
21:51 - Laura Dolphin: I just need to work through the relationship because you've got like
an if.
21:56 - Laura Dolphin: like sometimes contact, sometimes account.
21:58 - Laura Dolphin: So I just need to look at how we would do that.
22:00 - Laura Dolphin: It's likely just lookups that are not required so that you can do like an
either or.
22:07 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah.
22:08 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
22:10 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah, but that doesn't, I don't think that stops anything that you're
doing.
22:15 - Laura Dolphin: The only thing that would cause issue is if you're expecting us to do
like a data migration from what you've done.
22:23 - Laura Dolphin: And I don't think there's much data to do that to or pull that from.
22:28 - Laura Dolphin: So if you're expecting us to do like a data update, but it's still a net
new object.
22:34 - Laura Dolphin: and it doesn't really cause a lot of friction in what we're doing.
22:40 - Laura Dolphin: So that's why I was a little like I was confused about why it would.
22:44 - Laura Dolphin: why it came up when we're talking about the new data model, whether
it was just like, oh, we missed this and we want to include.
22:50 - Laura Dolphin: Or if there was something that you saw that it was like, this is not
going to work.
22:54 - Laura Dolphin: Because that's where I wanted to just clarify because it just sounds
like a net new object.
22:58 - Laura Dolphin: It sounds pretty straightforward.
22:59 - Lyndon: I think what we discovered was that we are, you know, Michael used the term
hack.
23:04 - Lyndon: We're using a hack in the system, and we want to try to fix those things.
23:08 - Laura Dolphin: Gotcha.
23:09 - Laura Dolphin: Yep, agreed.
23:10 - Laura Dolphin: But
23:10 - Lyndon: wait, just rolling it back.
23:12 - Lyndon: So Michael.
23:13 - Lyndon: Well, um...
23:16 - Lyndon: The individual, so applying the UCC filing at the individual level.
23:21 - Lyndon: and the organization level.
23:24 - Lyndon: So it's basically whoever is
23:27 - Lyndon: on an agreement.
23:28 - Lyndon: Is that right?
23:31 - Lyndon: Whatever entity.
23:33 - Lyndon: whether individual or otherwise.
23:36 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah.
23:37 - Michael Kianmahd: I say like,
23:38 - Michael Kianmahd: warm bodies and corporates and DBAs.
23:41 - Michael Kianmahd: So if there's a DBA, it's good to file one in the DBA name.
23:44 - Michael Kianmahd: plus one in the individual name, we have already that segmen-
tation.
23:49 - Lyndon: A sole proprietorship, no need to, because there's no...
23:52 - Lyndon: Move.
23:53 - Lyndon: Boof.
23:55 - Lyndon: I mean, the organization and the individual are one and the same, basically.
23:59 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah.
24:01 - Lyndon: Okay.
24:01 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah.
24:02 - Michael Kianmahd: And, and, uh, like the, why, like, why is that the case?
24:06 - Michael Kianmahd: because if somebody is doing business as a specific name,
24:10 - Michael Kianmahd: and some future lender looks that business up.
24:14 - Michael Kianmahd: they'll search in the name of the DBA and likely also.
24:19 - Michael Kianmahd: the name of the individual.
24:21 - Michael Kianmahd: So it's important to have both covered.
24:23 - Michael Kianmahd: So you're telling the world like
24:24 - Michael Kianmahd: I finance this stuff for that guy.
24:26 - Michael Kianmahd: That's my collateral.
24:28 - Michael Kianmahd: Stay away.
24:29 - Lyndon: Got it.
24:30 - Lyndon: Okay.
24:31 - Michael Kianmahd: Similarly, funky things happen where...
24:35 - Michael Kianmahd: people play games because they know how easy it is to
24:39 - Michael Kianmahd: Like...
24:42 - Michael Kianmahd: you know, stay under their radar with respect to what the liens
are.
24:45 - Michael Kianmahd: So they'll
24:46 - Michael Kianmahd: they'll randomly tell you, oh yeah, I have this DBA.
24:49 - Michael Kianmahd: and this equipment is owned by this DBA or this other entity.
24:54 - Michael Kianmahd: So if we're encumbering yellow iron that exists,
24:59 - Michael Kianmahd: we have to go through like a higher threshold of validating where
that equipment came from by getting like proof of.
25:04 - Michael Kianmahd: Ownership, paid invoices, those invoices have to be paid.
25:08 - Michael Kianmahd: by the company that we're financing and filing the UCC lien in.
25:11 - Michael Kianmahd: But that's more operational.
25:12 - Michael Kianmahd: That's less Salesforce related.
25:20 - jguevara: For an opportunity, we file UCC.
25:22 - jguevara: see today for multiple individuals that are on the opportunity.
25:27 - jguevara: wouldn't they all expire the same date?
25:30 - Michael Kianmahd: Yes.
25:31 - jguevara: Or...
25:32 - jguevara: So should we have maybe just one field and give us the option to say, hey,
we have.
25:38 - jguevara: three UCC filed for this deal or we have
25:43 - jguevara: Depending on how many guarantors are in there, instead of having separate
fields for each one of them.
25:50 - Michael Kianmahd: we
25:51 - jguevara: because they would all expire the same day they would all be started the
same date as well right
25:58 - Michael Kianmahd: I think that's true, but...
26:03 - Michael Kianmahd: Sometimes what happens is like.
26:08 - Michael Kianmahd: This happens a lot on like property, like we've encumbered three
properties.
26:12 - Michael Kianmahd: And then one gets sold and you've released on that one.
26:17 - Michael Kianmahd: but you keep the other two alive.
26:23 - Michael Kianmahd: So it's like almost like titles.
26:24 - Michael Kianmahd: Like if you have three titles.
26:27 - Michael Kianmahd: You know, and one title gets sold, one truck gets sold, you release
the title on that, you'd probably want...
26:33 - Michael Kianmahd: different dates of tracking.
26:35 - jguevara: Makes sense.
26:42 - Laura Dolphin: Okay.
26:43 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah.
26:43 - Michael Kianmahd: So just on your question of like how we came to discover this.
26:47 - Michael Kianmahd: We were doing a title report and looking at.
26:52 - Michael Kianmahd: how many titles were processed and how many were not.
26:56 - Michael Kianmahd: And then there was a gap in the data.
26:57 - Michael Kianmahd: because there's a bunch tagged as UCC and there are a bunch
that were
27:02 - Michael Kianmahd: Blank.
27:04 - Michael Kianmahd: because we started including BL opportunity records.
27:09 - Michael Kianmahd: So you had an inbound BL opportunity records, which typically
were not part of that report.
27:15 - Michael Kianmahd: So there was a void of data and then we started initially going
down the path of doing a cleanup job.
27:21 - Michael Kianmahd: basically going into that dropdown that I showed you and
selecting UCC filed.
27:26 - Michael Kianmahd: They basically said, you know what?
27:27 - Michael Kianmahd: This is probably a bad way of doing it.
27:30 - Michael Kianmahd: Let's do it the right way.
27:31 - Michael Kianmahd: Which is what triggered this conversation that Lynn started.
27:34 - Laura Dolphin: Okay.
27:34 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
27:36 - Laura Dolphin: That one could be served up probably pretty quick and like separate
from.
27:42 - Laura Dolphin: data model.
27:43 - Laura Dolphin: The only thing is that we won't have, like, we don't have any logic
because we don't have our new roles, but that shouldn't stop you really from.
27:48 - Laura Dolphin: I'm starting to like utilize an object that stores CCC filings.
27:52 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah.
27:53 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
27:54 - Laura Dolphin: Are you expecting any automation or is it acceptable that users like
when they file, they create records?
27:59 - Laura Dolphin: records and then they just select like they'd go into the opportunity
they'd create a record UCC filing
28:05 - Laura Dolphin: they'd name it with like probably the number or whatever that they
get back
28:10 - Laura Dolphin: and then they would basically select the account or contact.
28:16 - Michael Kianmahd: I'm not sure I understand like visually what you're saying.
28:19 - Michael Kianmahd: So
28:20 - Laura Dolphin: it's just similar to like.
28:22 - Laura Dolphin: creating any related record on any other record so I can like show you
but
28:30 - Laura Dolphin: Oops.
28:33 - Laura Dolphin: So if you're on an opportunity.
28:37 - Laura Dolphin: It would be just like almost identical to creating a collateral.
28:45 - Laura Dolphin: you would come into your opportunity and you create a record and it
would be in an object called.
28:50 - Laura Dolphin: use cc filing and you would literally just put in like the name
28:55 - Laura Dolphin: which would probably be the name that UCC, like I'm assuming when
you file, they give you like an auto number or something.
29:00 - Laura Dolphin: Something like that.
29:02 - Laura Dolphin: Is that how that works?
29:05 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah.
29:06 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah.
29:06 - Michael Kianmahd: Oh, so you're making like a UCC object.
29:09 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
29:10 - Laura Dolphin: Yes, there will be an object that you will need that will create and it'll
allow you then to store that.
29:15 - Laura Dolphin: And then what you can do is you'll have like a name field.
29:19 - Laura Dolphin: You'll have a relationship.
29:20 - Laura Dolphin: So similar to dealer, you'll just go in and say, I'm running my.
29:23 - Laura Dolphin: UCC filing on Laura's Thursdays.
29:26 - Laura Dolphin: There'll be two date fields or one date field.
29:28 - Laura Dolphin: expiration date, termination date, and then you'll populate those.
29:32 - Laura Dolphin: There might be a status field.
29:35 - Laura Dolphin: which I would recommend that defaults to like filed and then you can
update that to terminated.
29:42 - Laura Dolphin: cancelled whatever it is and then what happens is you have that you
would just
29:46 - Laura Dolphin: It would you would view it here and then they would all relate back to
either their contact or the account
29:51 - Laura Dolphin: and you could click on that and from that contact or the account you
could see all of their UCC filings and which
29:56 - Laura Dolphin: opportunities are related to and then you can easily use automation
30:01 - Laura Dolphin: So for example, if you have a UCC filing for Laura's Thursdays and it
expired yesterday.
30:07 - Laura Dolphin: right you can send an email to whoever created it to say hey this is
expired
30:13 - Laura Dolphin: Go do something.
30:18 - Laura Dolphin: That's how you handle those situations.
30:21 - Michael Kianmahd: Yep.
30:25 - Michael Kianmahd: Give me one second.
30:26 - Michael Kianmahd: I'm just pulling up an actual filing.
30:30 - Michael Kianmahd: Have you seen one before?
30:32 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah, when I was on site, but I mean, it didn't stick because it was
just like a.
30:37 - Laura Dolphin: this is what is part of the process.
30:39 - Laura Dolphin: It wasn't like a.
30:41 - Michael Kianmahd: Okay.
30:42 - Michael Kianmahd: So just like for FYI, like.
30:47 - Michael Kianmahd: So this is what an actual UCC financing statement looks like.
30:55 - Michael Kianmahd: This is who files it for us.
30:58 - Michael Kianmahd: So there is a file number.
31:00 - Laura Dolphin: Yes, the one, yeah.
31:02 - Michael Kianmahd: Which probably should be relevant.
31:03 - Michael Kianmahd: There's a file date.
31:05 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
31:06 - Michael Kianmahd: And then when you file it, the termination date.
31:09 - Michael Kianmahd: I think one thing we can automate is it's, I think, five years out.
31:13 - Laura Dolphin: Yep.
31:14 - Laura Dolphin: So all of that is pretty easy to just like in the object when you create
it.
31:19 - Laura Dolphin: the user so the only thing is we don't have an integration right so you
the user would have to like copy and paste
31:25 - Laura Dolphin: that number, but then the rest of it, if you tell us like.
31:30 - Laura Dolphin: set the termination date to five dates from the file date.
31:34 - Laura Dolphin: We can assume the file date is today or the user can put it in.
31:38 - Laura Dolphin: we would set the status to like filed and then they can change it they
need to
31:44 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah.
31:44 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
31:45 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
31:46 - Michael Kianmahd: So, so.
31:48 - Laura Dolphin: So
31:49 - Michael Kianmahd: fields we probably want to capture are filing date.
31:52 - Michael Kianmahd: filing number, expiration date, termination date to be filled up.
31:57 - Michael Kianmahd: In the future.
31:59 - Michael Kianmahd: And then maybe some notes, like just in case, like, I think what
happens is sometimes we are asked to subordinate.
32:06 - Michael Kianmahd: on receivables because somebody goes to a factor, it would
probably be elegant to keep that information there as well.
32:12 - Laura Dolphin: And do you want to attach that actual document to that record?
32:17 - Michael Kianmahd: The optionality too would be nice.
32:20 - Michael Kianmahd: We can decide on process later.
32:26 - Michael Kianmahd: Lynn, do you have any questions?
32:29 - Michael Kianmahd: Like about this for me or Laura or any other comments?
32:35 - Lyndon: No.
32:36 - Michael Kianmahd: Okay.
32:37 - Laura Dolphin: Okay.
32:38 - Laura Dolphin: I know we're running over.
32:39 - Laura Dolphin: Apologies.
32:41 - Laura Dolphin: I just have one quick question for you on like the new data model.
32:45 - Laura Dolphin: So I was going to review it, but we're obviously.
32:47 - Laura Dolphin: quite past.
32:49 - Laura Dolphin: So we are sending the
32:53 - Laura Dolphin: sorry, in terms of scoring right now.
32:57 - Laura Dolphin: And this is relevant because I think Charles had asked for, or there
was an issue with the broker-dealer relationship.
33:04 - Laura Dolphin: So we are removing broker dealer.
33:07 - Laura Dolphin: from opportunities and just having a single relationship there.
33:12 - Laura Dolphin: Do you want us to
33:13 - Laura Dolphin: You also send if there are titled or non-titled collateral.
33:18 - Laura Dolphin: that have a dealer associated, are we sending?
33:23 - Laura Dolphin: that data to scoring.
33:26 - Laura Dolphin: So for example, you have an opportunity and the referral source is a
broker.
33:29 - Laura Dolphin: And then there are two pieces of collateral and each of them has a
different dealer.
33:34 - Laura Dolphin: Are we sending those two dealers along with the broker over to Kin
with like.
33:40 - Laura Dolphin: their level of acceptance?
33:42 - Michael Kianmahd: Yes, we should.
33:43 - Laura Dolphin: Okay.
33:45 - Laura Dolphin: And then our question was.
33:51 - Laura Dolphin: Right.
33:51 - Laura Dolphin: So, okay.
33:54 - Laura Dolphin: So I have a quick
33:54 - Michael Kianmahd: question on that.
33:55 - Laura Dolphin: Like,
33:57 - Michael Kianmahd: is level of acceptance.
34:01 - Michael Kianmahd: in production today what it's going to be
34:03 - Laura Dolphin: yeah or
34:03 - Michael Kianmahd: is it going to be different
34:05 - Laura Dolphin: no it's the same we updated that that was like the new list that you
guys came up with earlier this year i think it was
34:10 - Michael Kianmahd: Okay.
34:11 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
34:11 - Laura Dolphin: So there's no changes there.
34:13 - Michael Kianmahd: Can I just take this opportunity to address something that's like
been.
34:17 - Michael Kianmahd: something that I want us to be aware of as a group.
34:22 - Michael Kianmahd: and B, probably need your help on to make sure we get this right.
34:26 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah, please do.
34:28 - Michael Kianmahd: Okay.
34:29 - Michael Kianmahd: So.
34:32 - Michael Kianmahd: I'm going to share this email that I sent out.
34:35 - Michael Kianmahd: So
34:35 - Laura Dolphin: let Juan go and get back to, I know it's month end.
34:39 - Michael Kianmahd: Juan.
34:41 - Michael Kianmahd: Unless you need anything.
34:43 - Laura Dolphin: You can use your additional time to test.
34:46 - Laura Dolphin: All
34:46 - jguevara: right.
34:48 - jguevara: Bye guys.
34:52 - Michael Kianmahd: Okay, so...
34:56 - Michael Kianmahd: Just to set context.
34:57 - Michael Kianmahd: So we've got a decision tree.
34:59 - Michael Kianmahd: and the decision tree pushes data out.
35:01 - Michael Kianmahd: Sorry, the...
35:03 - Michael Kianmahd: When you click score, data gets pushed out of Salesforce.
35:09 - Michael Kianmahd: and then it runs through the model and then it runs through the
decision tree.
35:13 - Michael Kianmahd: and then it kicks back results
35:15 - Laura Dolphin: yes
35:16 - Michael Kianmahd: okay
35:18 - Michael Kianmahd: Lynn, tell me if this is like too much detail, but I want to make
sure that this is like
35:22 - Michael Kianmahd: That you and I are 100% on sync on this because this is like a
recurring pattern that I have with Ken that
35:27 - Michael Kianmahd: They just don't seem to understand.
35:29 - Michael Kianmahd: So...
35:31 - Michael Kianmahd: The data model for Salesforce is changing.
35:35 - Michael Kianmahd: Because of that change.
35:37 - Michael Kianmahd: The decision tree rules and kickback.
35:41 - Michael Kianmahd: has to be mapped correctly.
35:46 - Michael Kianmahd: So it sounds like Laura confirmed that the
35:48 - Michael Kianmahd: The current drop downs that are at the dealer or.
35:53 - Michael Kianmahd: broker acceptance level so when you go into salesforce let me
be specific again
36:00 - Laura Dolphin: Can
36:00 - Michael Kianmahd: you guys see my Salesforce screen?
36:03 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
36:03 - Michael Kianmahd: Okay.
36:03 - Michael Kianmahd: So if you go here.
36:04 - Michael Kianmahd: Let's just go to like a closed deal.
36:07 - Michael Kianmahd: So, Glenn, I want to take this opportunity to make sure that you.
36:11 - Michael Kianmahd: Have a feel for this.
36:14 - Michael Kianmahd: level of detail.
36:16 - Laura Dolphin: This is what I was talking about as well, too.
36:18 - Laura Dolphin: So hopefully that's my question.
36:21 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah.
36:21 - Michael Kianmahd: Chao.
36:24 - Michael Kianmahd: So when you go to a level of acceptance.
36:30 - Michael Kianmahd: at the opportunity level.
36:33 - Michael Kianmahd: You have a dealer and you have a broker related to this deal.
36:39 - Michael Kianmahd: So let's go and open up the dealer account and let's open up the
broker account.
36:44 - Michael Kianmahd: When you open up the dealer account.
36:48 - Michael Kianmahd: It's type vendor.
36:52 - Michael Kianmahd: So is that opportunity record type or is that an account record
type?
36:55 - Laura Dolphin: No, that's just a type.
36:57 - Laura Dolphin: Aaron
36:57 - Michael Kianmahd: Pratt.
36:58 - Michael Kianmahd: Okay.
36:58 - Michael Kianmahd: So that's okay.
37:01 - Michael Kianmahd: Then you go to level of acceptance.
37:03 - Michael Kianmahd: There's a drop down list.
37:07 - Michael Kianmahd: that has a bunch of options that we're supposed to be actively
managing.
37:12 - Michael Kianmahd: So for example, if a dealer or broker screws us,
37:16 - Michael Kianmahd: we would make a decision to put them on a watch list or blacklist.
37:19 - Michael Kianmahd: If we get an inbound and nobody's really checked them out yet.
37:23 - Michael Kianmahd: it might be in pending review.
37:25 - Michael Kianmahd: If we've accepted them, but we haven't.
37:27 - Michael Kianmahd: gotten a signed agreement in place with them yet, but we've like
done our diligence and we're just like waiting.
37:32 - Michael Kianmahd: we put them in the accepted pending agreement queue.
37:37 - Michael Kianmahd: And this is for a dealer.
37:42 - Michael Kianmahd: Okay.
37:43 - Michael Kianmahd: I think
37:44 - Laura Dolphin: it's the same for brokers, just so you know.
37:46 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah, it's actually not.
37:48 - Michael Kianmahd: It's actually different.
37:49 - Laura Dolphin: Okay, well, the system process defaults to the pending review for both
of them.
37:55 - Laura Dolphin: when they're created, just so you know.
37:57 - Michael Kianmahd: Pending review
37:58 - Laura Dolphin: is default.
37:59 - Laura Dolphin: If you create a new broker or vendor, and if you're not like Fernando.
38:05 - Laura Dolphin: Then it goes to pending review when your intake team submits it.
38:08 - Michael Kianmahd: Okay, cool.
38:09 - Michael Kianmahd: So you're saying the dropdown is the same?
38:13 - Laura Dolphin: The drop down is the same list.
38:14 - Laura Dolphin: Doesn't matter if you're a broker, doesn't matter if you're a dealer,
doesn't matter if you're a customer.
38:19 - Michael Kianmahd: I'm really glad you said that, okay?
38:21 - Michael Kianmahd: Because...
38:24 - Michael Kianmahd: We got an email from Carlos.
38:28 - Michael Kianmahd: that I looped you in on.
38:30 - Laura Dolphin: Okay.
38:31 - Michael Kianmahd: And
38:33 - Michael Kianmahd: We're pushing data out to the scoring engine and the scoring
engine.
38:38 - Michael Kianmahd: took this opportunity ID.
38:41 - Michael Kianmahd: So are you aware of this case yet?
38:43 - Laura Dolphin: I am because I asked, I went back to Carlos and I asked a question
and I said like, cause it was an issue.
38:50 - Laura Dolphin: one of them didn't exist.
38:51 - Laura Dolphin: If this is the same opportunity, there was another opportunity, I think,
and one of them didn't exist and their rule was evaluating.
38:58 - Laura Dolphin: if it was null, it was returning watch list, I think.
39:01 - Laura Dolphin: And I asked a question just being like, what are you currently doing?
39:05 - Laura Dolphin: Because we're about to change relationships.
39:07 - Laura Dolphin: And I just want to make sure I'm not going to be like messing anything
up.
39:11 - Laura Dolphin: So yeah, but I am aware.
39:13 - Michael Kianmahd: Okay.
39:13 - Michael Kianmahd: So this one has a dealer level of acceptance, except.
39:17 - Michael Kianmahd: Did agreement in place?
39:19 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah, sorry, this is the one, yeah.
39:21 - Michael Kianmahd: Okay, but according to Carlos, it kicked back.
39:25 - Michael Kianmahd: broker-dealer watch list rule.
39:28 - Laura Dolphin: Yes.
39:29 - Michael Kianmahd: Which...
39:30 - Michael Kianmahd: I'm not sure like
39:33 - Michael Kianmahd: I'm not sure he understands what he's saying 95% of the time.
39:38 - Laura Dolphin: That is also true.
39:39 - Laura Dolphin: It's Christian who is actually the...
39:42 - Michael Kianmahd: Okay.
39:42 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah, Carlos is
39:43 - Michael Kianmahd: just a
39:43 - Laura Dolphin: female.
39:44 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah, so like not to be rude.
39:46 - Lyndon: So Ken has a business rule.
39:51 - Lyndon: Is it an or that if either a broker or vendor?
39:55 - Lyndon: is on watch list
39:56 - Laura Dolphin: it's both so the way that here let me just pull up christians because
this is what i was
40:01 - Laura Dolphin: This
40:01 - Michael Kianmahd: is what Lynn is asking.
40:02 - Michael Kianmahd: It's two separate categories.
40:08 - Michael Kianmahd: Oh, yeah.
40:09 - Michael Kianmahd: dealer or broker blacklist check.
40:12 - Laura Dolphin: Yep.
40:14 - Michael Kianmahd: broker or dealer watch list check
40:18 - Michael Kianmahd: And that's for the TR model.
40:19 - Michael Kianmahd: And the BL model is basically the same thing.
40:23 - Michael Kianmahd: But what I'm trying to point out.
40:26 - Michael Kianmahd: that I want all of us to be incredibly laser focused on is how
40:31 - Michael Kianmahd: Our friend Carlos is not even.
40:35 - Michael Kianmahd: calling out the correct dropdown lists.
40:40 - Michael Kianmahd: Look at that.
40:40 - Michael Kianmahd: It says pending broker review, pending dealer review, pending
credit review.
40:44 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah, those are old.
40:46 - Michael Kianmahd: Those are old.
40:47 - Laura Dolphin: Okay, so but just beware that Christian emailed me on this.
40:50 - Laura Dolphin: the original email yesterday or two days ago and gave me the correct
40:56 - Laura Dolphin: Okay,
40:56 - Michael Kianmahd: but I'm not aware because I'm not informed.
40:59 - Laura Dolphin: And when
40:59 - Michael Kianmahd: I
40:59 - Laura Dolphin: asked
41:00 - Michael Kianmahd: Carlos, Carlos doesn't know what he's saying.
41:02 - Michael Kianmahd: And Jacob heard that interaction.
41:04 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
41:05 - Michael Kianmahd: Okay.
41:06 - Michael Kianmahd: So it's.
41:07 - Michael Kianmahd: I can't.
41:09 - Michael Kianmahd: You know, I read this and nobody responded for two days.
41:13 - Michael Kianmahd: like didn't respond to see what would happen nobody responded
because nobody owns it right
41:18 - Michael Kianmahd: So then I feel obligation to own it.
41:20 - Michael Kianmahd: And then I look at it and it's wrong.
41:23 - Michael Kianmahd: and there's stuff happening in the background.
41:26 - Michael Kianmahd: that I'm not aware of.
41:31 - Laura Dolphin: Was I on the actual original email?
41:33 - Michael Kianmahd: You're not.
41:34 - Michael Kianmahd: I looped you into it.
41:35 - Laura Dolphin: Okay.
41:35 - Laura Dolphin: So I'm on the actual original email that, um, where Charles like.
41:40 - Laura Dolphin: raised the issue.
41:43 - Laura Dolphin: It's not like a decision that I needed to make, but I asked a question.
41:46 - Laura Dolphin: So
41:47 - Laura Dolphin: Let me just put in here what I think their logic is that will.
41:52 - Laura Dolphin: Like ignore Carlos for a second.
41:54 - Michael Kianmahd: This is what should happen
41:56 - Michael Kianmahd: this is what should happen so i like i spent 20 minutes on this
just looking at it
42:03 - Michael Kianmahd: So if a dealer or broker is declined or blacklisted,
42:09 - Michael Kianmahd: we should get a auto decline.
42:13 - Michael Kianmahd: If the level of acceptance is none and a pending review watch
list accepted pending agreement, it should trigger a review.
42:25 - Michael Kianmahd: And then everything else shouldn't trigger anything.
42:28 - Michael Kianmahd: All the other categories in the dropdown shouldn't trigger any-
thing.
42:34 - Michael Kianmahd: none of these were part of like these these are the options carlos
gave two days ago
42:38 - Michael Kianmahd: I'm not sure when you talk to Chris, but he's still referring to old
data model dropdown.
42:43 - Michael Kianmahd: Once.
42:46 - Michael Kianmahd: So it's just been a little bit of like a hard thing to get everybody
on the same page on.
42:51 - Michael Kianmahd: And I like.
42:53 - Michael Kianmahd: other than having one person be the owner of all these types of
issues.
42:58 - Michael Kianmahd: I can't think of a better way because it gets like disintermediated.
43:01 - Michael Kianmahd: And then we make, we do like.
43:04 - Michael Kianmahd: We start like, we spend like an hour talking about something, but
nobody really understands how everything connects.
43:09 - Michael Kianmahd: And then it goes off this one direction and then we clean it up
later.
43:12 - Michael Kianmahd: So I just I want to get out of that habit
43:17 - Michael Kianmahd: That's my view on what happened.
43:18 - Michael Kianmahd: I could be wrong.
43:22 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah, so.
43:24 - Lyndon: Michael, what's the ask?
43:25 - Lyndon: Are you asking for me to...
43:26 - Lyndon: to connect with christian and carlos on this are you
43:33 - Michael Kianmahd: I'm asking Laura to loop
43:36 - Lyndon: the
43:36 - Michael Kianmahd: appropriate person.
43:37 - Michael Kianmahd: in so that she gets the right answer so she doesn't waste her
time
43:43 - Michael Kianmahd: I'm asking Ken to use updated data model.
43:47 - Michael Kianmahd: nomenclature so we don't get confused about what we're trying
43:50 - Lyndon: to do.
43:51 - Lyndon: Carlos, reference an old design doc.
43:53 - Lyndon: Right.
43:53 - Michael Kianmahd: Correct.
43:54 - Lyndon: Or an old email.
43:56 - Michael Kianmahd: And it sounds like two people from Kin were...
43:58 - Michael Kianmahd: communicating about it with two different audiences.
44:03 - Michael Kianmahd: right like laura was included in one and one not the other and
carlos was asking us
44:08 - Michael Kianmahd: Like Carlos sent this email asking for.
44:16 - Michael Kianmahd: I don't even know what he's asking here.
44:20 - Michael Kianmahd: just maybe an update, but it's wrong.
44:23 - Michael Kianmahd: And he's saying that they're spending time, which we spend
money on.
44:27 - Michael Kianmahd: to fix something and it's not even the right solution.
44:31 - Michael Kianmahd: And, you know, I think.
44:36 - Michael Kianmahd: We just have to be aware of these.
44:40 - Michael Kianmahd: recurring patterns and just make sure that, you know, Lynn, if it's
something you got.
44:46 - Michael Kianmahd: you're owning it, if it's something you need my opinion on,
especially as you're getting more familiar with all this stuff, because it's a lot to absorb.
44:54 - Michael Kianmahd: Took me like a year just to understand the differences.
44:58 - Michael Kianmahd: um loop me in i'd be happy to opine and go over the details so
we get it right because i don't
45:03 - Michael Kianmahd: I don't want to keep stumbling on stuff like this.
45:10 - Laura Dolphin: So can I just ask my question?
45:12 - Michael Kianmahd: Sure.
45:12 - Laura Dolphin: I completely understand exactly what the issue is and it has nothing
to do with the values.
45:17 - Laura Dolphin: The issue is the fact that you have a dealer and a broker relationship
on the opportunity and the opportunity where the issue came from.
45:24 - Laura Dolphin: The broker was missing and the current rule they have.
45:28 - Laura Dolphin: if one of them is NA or null.
45:32 - Laura Dolphin: then it's going to go to manual review.
45:38 - Laura Dolphin: Sorry, and then if one of them is missing and the other one is...
45:44 - Laura Dolphin: if one uh evaluating missing info yeah so if they're like basically the
missing information on the broke
45:50 - Laura Dolphin: made it go to watch list.
45:52 - Laura Dolphin: So my question and the reason I asked this to Christian is because
we're basically taking away the dealer and the broker.
45:58 - Laura Dolphin: going forward.
45:59 - Laura Dolphin: That's your new data model as of like last week.
46:04 - Laura Dolphin: we're not going to have a dealer and a broker on the opportunity as it
is today.
46:08 - Laura Dolphin: We are going to have a single referral source contact, so that will
essentially get rid of the issue.
46:15 - Laura Dolphin: not that we don't need to fix it now.
46:19 - Lyndon: Michael, let me ask this question.
46:20 - Lyndon: If it's a broker deal.
46:23 - Lyndon: the collateral being purchased is through a vendor
46:26 - Lyndon: that's on the watch list, does that need to be on the watch list?
46:30 - Lyndon: Like does that need to be pended out?
46:32 - Michael Kianmahd: Yes.
46:32 - Lyndon: So that is a unique requirement then.
46:35 - Laura Dolphin: So if any broker or dealer who belongs.
46:39 - Laura Dolphin: Like who has a relationship to the opportunity or the collateral.
46:44 - Laura Dolphin: We need to consider that.
46:45 - Michael Kianmahd: Yes.
46:46 - Laura Dolphin: Okay.
46:47 - Laura Dolphin: If one does not exist.
46:48 - Laura Dolphin: today.
46:49 - Laura Dolphin: So that's data model going forward today.
46:52 - Laura Dolphin: The way that they have it is if you have a dealer, but not a broker or
vice versa.
46:56 - Laura Dolphin: they're like considering that should we just should I go back to them
and say
47:01 - Laura Dolphin: do not consider if it's null.
47:03 - Laura Dolphin: because that would solve the issue.
47:06 - Michael Kianmahd: So if it's a dealer originated deal, no broker.
47:12 - Michael Kianmahd: and the dealer has no flag, whether auto decline or review.
47:17 - Michael Kianmahd: it shouldn't trigger because broker is null.
47:20 - Laura Dolphin: Okay.
47:22 - Michael Kianmahd: So if null is causing a false trigger, that...
47:26 - Michael Kianmahd: It's a separate issue than what I'm talking about.
47:29 - Michael Kianmahd: But I
47:29 - Laura Dolphin: agree
47:30 - Michael Kianmahd: that it shouldn't trigger a review.
47:32 - Michael Kianmahd: if broker is null.
47:33 - Michael Kianmahd: However, if broker is clear,
47:37 - Michael Kianmahd: and dealer is on watch list, it should trigger a review.
47:45 - Laura Dolphin: Okay, sorry.
47:46 - Laura Dolphin: Reverse that.
47:48 - Laura Dolphin: If dealer is clear, but broker is on watch list, it should also trigger a
review, right?
47:53 - Michael Kianmahd: Basically, if anybody we're seeing a deal from or buying equip-
ment from, regardless of referral source, is on a watch list.
48:00 - Michael Kianmahd: It should trigger something.
48:01 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
48:02 - Laura Dolphin: Okay.
48:03 - Laura Dolphin: So that's what's happening today as they're just considering no.
48:06 - Laura Dolphin: If you look at the opportunity that caused.
48:08 - Laura Dolphin: this the broker is missing and so I believe that they
48:13 - Michael Kianmahd: were like
48:14 - Laura Dolphin: that's the issue is that it went because they're looking for it and it
doesn't exist.
48:18 - Laura Dolphin: And so they put it on a wall.
48:20 - Laura Dolphin: so there's
48:23 - Michael Kianmahd: the the null issue
48:25 - Michael Kianmahd: which you're which is the one you were working on right
48:28 - Laura Dolphin: i'm not working no that that's what
48:30 - Laura Dolphin: Carlos and Christian, that is the issue that Charles raised.
48:34 - Laura Dolphin: He hasn't, like, there's an opportunity that went to.
48:39 - Laura Dolphin: watch list.
48:41 - Laura Dolphin: It's the David E.
48:42 - Laura Dolphin: Griffith.
48:43 - Laura Dolphin: trucking it went to broker dealer watchlist check manual review
because there is no broker
48:50 - Laura Dolphin: And I asked Christian, why is this happening?
48:53 - Laura Dolphin: And he said.
48:55 - Laura Dolphin: because the broker is null, they are considering that as N-A and that
48:59 - Laura Dolphin: is one of their rules that goes to watch list manual review.
49:04 - Laura Dolphin: So if you want, I feel like I'm placed to.
49:08 - Laura Dolphin: You respond to Carlos and say, first of all, like.
49:12 - Laura Dolphin: get the right pick list values.
49:14 - Laura Dolphin: I feel confident because it's working and we've tested that and that's
been working.
49:18 - Laura Dolphin: for ages so i'm not i'm not concerned about carlos getting the picklist
values wrong but it
49:23 - Laura Dolphin: I can instruct them to say, like, if a broker or a dealer is null on the
opportunity, remove that from consideration.
49:30 - Laura Dolphin: and just score based off of the dealer or broker.
49:35 - Laura Dolphin: because you already have validation rules that exist today that make
you have a broker or dealer.
49:40 - Laura Dolphin: when it's needed.
49:41 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
49:43 - Laura Dolphin: Yeah.
49:44 - Michael Kianmahd: Okay.
49:45 - Laura Dolphin: So going forward then.
49:47 - Laura Dolphin: this issue will naturally be solved because we will only have one on
the opportunity.
49:52 - Laura Dolphin: However, we will also have potentially a
49:54 - Laura Dolphin: additional dealers and then i will have to make it clear at that point to
all score
50:00 - Laura Dolphin: that we will have to actually consider any of them because there
might not be two anymore.
50:06 - Laura Dolphin: It might be three, there might be four, which we don't have today.
50:09 - Laura Dolphin: That's
50:10 - Michael Kianmahd: new.
50:11 - Laura Dolphin: We will have to consider all of them.
50:12 - Laura Dolphin: But if they're null, we don't care.
50:14 - Laura Dolphin: Correct?
50:15 - Laura Dolphin: Awesome.
50:16 - Laura Dolphin: Okay.
50:16 - Laura Dolphin: That answers my questions.
50:18 - Laura Dolphin: Lyndon, I don't want to step on your toes.
50:20 - Laura Dolphin: Are you both happy if I respond?
50:23 - Laura Dolphin: to Carlos and take that one or do you want to take
50:27 - Lyndon: that?
50:27 - Lyndon: Yeah.
50:27 - Lyndon: Okay.
50:28 - Laura Dolphin: No, please.
50:28 - Laura Dolphin: Okay, perfect.
50:30 - Laura Dolphin: That's all I have for today.
50:31 - Laura Dolphin: I will redo the...
50:33 - Laura Dolphin: the data model diagrams and send those back with the UCC filings.
50:38 - Laura Dolphin: And then I do have the tasks and stuff.
50:40 - Laura Dolphin: broken out um i did have one last question there is a way for me to
like cut out some of the work and make that
50:46 - Laura Dolphin: Phase two, like updating integrations.
50:50 - Laura Dolphin: It's not my favorite, but if.
50:52 - Laura Dolphin: We like looking at all the tasks and the estimates and stuff that I've
got for everything, like all the changes that we've had.
50:59 - Laura Dolphin: It's not a small piece of work.
51:02 - Laura Dolphin: because there's a lot of integrations and automations that we need
to update.
51:06 - Laura Dolphin: So your option to get your model
51:08 - Laura Dolphin: Your data model kind of like into production quicker with everything
that we want is.
51:13 - Laura Dolphin: just to keep the old relationships on the opportunity but hidden and
then I'll just
51:18 - Laura Dolphin: I'll fill them up with basically an automation from the new source.
51:22 - Laura Dolphin: And then what we'll do is as soon as we're live, we will work on.
51:26 - Laura Dolphin: like actually getting rid of those and deprecating them and updating
our integrations.
51:30 - Laura Dolphin: So I'll leave the option with you.
51:34 - Laura Dolphin: We can do it either way.
51:35 - Laura Dolphin: Obviously, option one is we do everything, but it's just going to be a
longer lead time to get the data model.
51:42 - Laura Dolphin: in production.
51:44 - Laura Dolphin: Option two is you'll get your data model a lot quicker.
51:48 - Laura Dolphin: because I'll just keep them there, keep them running.
51:52 - Laura Dolphin: serve them through like an automation.
51:56 - Laura Dolphin: And then we'll work on actually deprecating the dealer and the broker
relationships later.
52:01 - Michael Kianmahd: Can you define the choice one more time?
52:04 - Laura Dolphin: So choice number one is to actually fully deprecate like.
52:08 - Laura Dolphin: get rid of broker dealer relationships on opportunities and replace it
with like the new relationship
52:14 - Laura Dolphin: Or to basically take two into one option, that's option A.
52:18 - Laura Dolphin: We actually have to up.
52:19 - Laura Dolphin: update our integrations we have to like break all of our automations
and like rebuild them
52:25 - Laura Dolphin: before you get your data model live.
52:28 - Laura Dolphin: Option two is we keep those relationships as is.
52:32 - Laura Dolphin: We start using a new one.
52:33 - Laura Dolphin: So we like hide the broker-dealer relationship, basically.
52:37 - Laura Dolphin: but I will still fill them in so that your integrations don't change.
52:42 - Laura Dolphin: your automations don't change, but you get your data model quicker.
52:47 - Laura Dolphin: And then basically as soon as we go live, then we will still do the work.
52:51 - Laura Dolphin: to fully like update your integrations and all of that, but you will be live
with your data model.
52:57 - Laura Dolphin: and we will work on that behind the scenes.
52:59 - Laura Dolphin: So we're still doing all of the work.
53:02 - Laura Dolphin: it's just you can get your data model quicker with kind of like a
53:06 - Laura Dolphin: I don't want to call it a band-aid, but it kind of is.
53:10 - Laura Dolphin: or we have to spend the time and do all of it and then give you your
data model.
53:16 - Laura Dolphin: I'd personally recommend the band-aid and I normally don't take that
approach.
53:21 - Laura Dolphin: but this has already been in the works so long and we're now getting
at risk of having so much work.
53:27 - Laura Dolphin: that's sitting there and getting stale with additional like changes that
are kind of going to be introduced as well.
53:33 - Laura Dolphin: So it's risky having any project like this sit for too long.
53:39 - Laura Dolphin: in like a sandbox environment and getting bigger and bigger and
bigger.
53:42 - Laura Dolphin: So that would be my recommendation, but I will leave that one with
you.
53:46 - Michael Kianmahd: Lynn, do you have opinions about that?
53:49 - Lyndon: I think we've taken steps down the path of getting something in.
53:53 - Lyndon: in place sooner than later and allowing the door to be open for phase two
type of stuff so
54:00 - Laura Dolphin: So
54:00 - Lyndon: I know that's, you know, by the way, Laura's couching it.
54:03 - Lyndon: It's obvious that's her preference as well.
54:05 - Lyndon: So I'd say we continue down that path.
54:08 - Laura Dolphin: Okay.
54:10 - Michael Kianmahd: Option A selected.
54:12 - Laura Dolphin: Okay.
