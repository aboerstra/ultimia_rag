01:23 - Cory Gambello: Exactly.
01:27 - Cory Gambello: Yeah, she's been on the tyrant lately.
01:30 - Cory Gambello: She had me plant over 100 plants in the backyard the other day.
01:35 - Cory Gambello: She was pushing for like 10 trees and I got her down to like six,
Michael.
01:40 - Cory Gambello: So she's got another four to go and I'm going to try to avoid that.

03:24 - Laura: Cool.
03:28 - Laura: Okay, well, I'll kick off.
03:30 - Laura: I do have a hard stop because I'm meeting with the team.
03:33 - Laura: So Aio is live.
03:35 - Laura: So I'm just going to meet with Juan, Charles, Dana, and Fernando after this to
talk about launch and communications out to your first referral partners.
03:46 - Laura: And hopefully we'll have a checklist to assign to one of them today so that we
can actually start using it.
03:55 - Michael Kianmahd: Cool.
03:56 - Laura: Yeah, so that's the news for the day.
04:00 - Laura: Beyond that, we've got, I know Caleb sent you the statement of work, you
signed it.
04:05 - Laura: So we should have our like new hours project soon.
04:09 - Laura: So that's what this is.
04:11 - Laura: And then our new, well, new Axia starts early June, but we have a conversation
with Dave next Tuesday about that.
04:19 - Laura: So ours is, yeah, that's where we're at.
04:25 - Laura: Two, three things that I have for you.
04:29 - Laura: The first one is, I am actually probably gonna push this off just to make sure
that we have enough hours until we get to Axia.
04:36 - Laura: but eight by eight, we went through this like a few months ago and I can't find
the email you were gonna share with me like a login access to the system.
04:48 - Laura: I don't, I can't find that.
04:50 - Laura: Are you able to like invite me again, please?
04:54 - Michael Kianmahd: It's gonna cost you.
04:56 - Laura: Sorry.
05:01 - Laura: What's the cost?
05:05 - Laura: One trip down.
05:07 - Michael Kianmahd: Faye has to send lunch to the office.
05:11 - Laura: Done, Cory, that's on your plate.
05:15 - Laura: We'll get David to bring it over.
05:17 - Michael Kianmahd: You got it.
05:18 - Laura: Okay.
05:19 - Laura: Do you pay for users on 8x8?
05:21 - Laura: Or is it usage?
05:23 - Michael Kianmahd: We pay for licenses, but you can create users and not assign
licenses.
05:30 - Laura: Yeah, okay, cool.
05:31 - Laura: Cause I don't need like an actual phone number, at least yet.
05:34 - Laura: Yeah.
05:35 - Laura: Yeah, okay.
05:37 - Michael Kianmahd: So I think I have it.
05:39 - Michael Kianmahd: It goes to your Laura at Max of Cc email.
05:42 - Laura: That's perfect, yeah.
05:43 - Laura: And I just need like an administrative so I can get in there and see if there's
any like plugin stuff.
05:51 - Michael Kianmahd: Okay, can you just confirm you got the reset password?
05:54 - Laura: Yeah, let me see.
06:01 - Michael Kianmahd: Corey, do you wanna log into?
06:06 - Cory Gambello: Got it.
06:06 - Michael Kianmahd: I'm okay.
06:07 - Michael Kianmahd: Okay, good.
06:08 - Laura: Yeah, I got it.
06:11 - Laura: Okay, thank you.
06:13 - Laura: I will get in and I'll make sure that I get myself in today and then, but I'll park
this setup until probably I'm back from my holidays next week or the week after.
06:24 - Michael Kianmahd: Where are you headed I forgot.
06:26 - Michael Kianmahd: Nashville.
06:27 - Michael Kianmahd: Oh, that's right.
06:28 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah.
06:29 - Laura: Yeah, whiskey and live music.
06:32 - Michael Kianmahd: Go easy on the live music, okay?
06:40 - Laura: Hopefully I really want to meet or I want to see Post Malone live so wish me
luck.
06:44 - Michael Kianmahd: You should watch Tiny Desk Concert Post Malone.
06:48 - Laura: Tiny Desk Concert Post Malone.
06:51 - Laura: Okay, that's a mouthful.
06:52 - Michael Kianmahd: It's amazing.
06:53 - Laura: Okay, he's amazing.
06:55 - Laura: I love him and he like lives there.
06:58 - Laura: So we'll see.
06:59 - Laura: I think there's a lot of artists who live there.
07:02 - Laura: So anyways, that's where I will be from next Wednesday through to the
following Monday.
07:08 - Laura: Business goals.
07:12 - Laura: We've sort of discussed some goals, but most of them are fairly technology
focused.
07:18 - Laura: Are you able to share those with me for like the next year or two?
07:24 - Laura: Like I'm talking like, are you trying to increase revenue by X amount?
07:28 - Laura: trying to like reduce turnover.
07:31 - Michael Kianmahd: Do you have- What are our business goals?
07:34 - Laura: Yeah.
07:36 - Michael Kianmahd: Like financial business goals, operational?
07:40 - Laura: All.
07:41 - Laura: All?
07:43 - Michael Kianmahd: I could probably...
07:50 - Laura: And I don't need like detailed, I just kind of need like, you know, increased
revenue by X amount by X state, like reduced turnover, like those types of things.
08:07 - Laura: The ones that we've talked about are fairly technology focused.
08:11 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah.
08:13 - Laura: I see if I can- Right now either, just like if you can kind of email them or chat
them to me or something later.
08:20 - Michael Kianmahd: Do you want, do you want
08:33 - Michael Kianmahd: I'm trying to think about how to send this to you.
08:44 - Michael Kianmahd: So I think we want to grow the balance sheet.
08:48 - Laura: You can spit them out now if you have them.
08:51 - Laura: I'll just write them down.
08:52 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah.
08:54 - Michael Kianmahd: I think it'd be helpful.
08:56 - Michael Kianmahd: Can I run you through this really fast guys?
09:00 - Laura: Yeah, I only have the duplicate tool and I've got 20 other minutes so that's uh
09:06 - Michael Kianmahd: go for it.
09:07 - Michael Kianmahd: Might be helpful but this was our company meeting last year
that we did.
09:12 - Laura: Oh yeah.
09:13 - Michael Kianmahd: Can I show this to you?
09:15 - Laura: No, you um there was like a document that was output But from this meeting,
but it was that like, very, I have that, but I don't have this 1.
09:25 - Michael Kianmahd: That was separate, but basically.
09:31 - Michael Kianmahd: This is our market segment.
09:33 - Michael Kianmahd: It's 85 dollars a year of financing volume.
09:37 - Michael Kianmahd: Okay, we think the addressable markets about 15million.
09:42 - Michael Kianmahd: So, 1, market share is about 150million dollars a year of origina-
tion.
09:47 - Laura: Okay.
09:49 - Michael Kianmahd: I think we're funding right now anywhere from one to three and
a half million a year.
09:55 - Michael Kianmahd: Or sorry, a month.
09:57 - Michael Kianmahd: I'd like to fund, like, as soon as we get our technology figured out
and our models figured out and we feel good about our ability to sort of estimate risk and
price it well and operate efficiently.
10:17 - Michael Kianmahd: I'd like to get to$5 million a month and then$7 million and
then$10 million.
10:22 - Michael Kianmahd: $5 million a month equates to about a$100 million portfolio size.
10:27 - Michael Kianmahd: $10 million a month obviously is$200 million.
10:30 - Michael Kianmahd: So just do the math.
10:32 - Laura: By when?
10:33 - Michael Kianmahd: Are you in the year?
10:35 - Michael Kianmahd: I want to be in the position to be doing$5 million a month by the
end of the year, latest.
10:41 - Laura: End of 2025.
10:42 - Laura: Yep.
10:43 - Laura: And then is 10 and a 2026?
10:48 - Michael Kianmahd: Let's say seven.
10:49 - Laura: Okay.
10:52 - Michael Kianmahd: Cool.
10:53 - Michael Kianmahd: And then 2027 10.
10:56 - Laura: Yeah.
10:57 - Laura: And you said you're 24 million currently, you said about one to three per month.
11:03 - Michael Kianmahd: Is that about 24?
11:04 - Michael Kianmahd: Like, we're doing about I don't know, because like this last month
and a half, like everything crashed.
11:10 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah.
11:11 - Michael Kianmahd: But like, I think we're at, we were pacing at 40 for the year.
11:20 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah.
11:22 - Michael Kianmahd: Which you know, is over three.
11:24 - Michael Kianmahd: But I think it's now down to like 35.
11:27 - Michael Kianmahd: But I don't know.
11:28 - Michael Kianmahd: I don't know what's gonna happen.
11:29 - Michael Kianmahd: It's very weird.
11:31 - Laura: Okay.
11:32 - Michael Kianmahd: Okay.
11:34 - Michael Kianmahd: The other sort of
11:38 - Michael Kianmahd: You know, this is actually a good quote, helping one person might
change the whole world, but it could change the world for one person.
11:43 - Michael Kianmahd: So like folks we finance, oftentimes don't have other options to
get financing.
11:51 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah.
11:51 - Michael Kianmahd: And it's the difference of them starting their business, keeping
their business, growing their business.
11:57 - Michael Kianmahd: So we find a lot of meaning in that.
12:00 - Michael Kianmahd: So, thank you.
12:01 - Michael Kianmahd: You should too.
12:03 - Michael Kianmahd: Okay.
12:04 - Michael Kianmahd: Um, but we hired last year, 2023, actually.
12:09 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah.
12:11 - Michael Kianmahd: Um, really, you know, I'm sure you've met some of these people
when you were here.
12:19 - Michael Kianmahd: Um, these are the projects we're working on.
12:22 - Michael Kianmahd: So refi, we got done can analytics working on that.
12:27 - Michael Kianmahd: It's it's like, it's, it's always something we always do and maintain.
12:30 - Michael Kianmahd: So there's, there's like details related to that least works in
salesforce synergies and security, that's kind of on your roadmap.
12:38 - Michael Kianmahd: Salesforce improvements, it's pretty much the focus, and then
process improvements.
12:43 - Michael Kianmahd: And then this is probably one of the most consequential.
12:47 - Michael Kianmahd: Thank you.
12:50 - Laura: Cory, is that you?
12:52 - Laura: That's me.
12:54 - Laura: Is that you?
12:58 - Michael Kianmahd: So this, I want to work.
13:08 - Laura: I was going
13:12 - Laura: to say, that was the guy that called earlier.
13:15 - Laura: That, to that, it would be like my husband partner.
13:19 - Michael Kianmahd: That would be him.
13:20 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah.
13:20 - Michael Kianmahd: That's pretty much what I look like with the financial statements
in front of me.
13:26 - Michael Kianmahd: I look that good.
13:28 - Michael Kianmahd: But yeah, I mean, obviously it's like a metaphor, right?
13:33 - Laura: Yeah, that's when I'm working smarter, not harder is one of my favorites.
13:37 - Michael Kianmahd: And then these are like, we hit this goal.
13:41 - Michael Kianmahd: This is 2024.
13:43 - Michael Kianmahd: We wanted to build capacity as a company, we hit that with it
projects and process improvement, which obviously take longer than we expect.
13:52 - Michael Kianmahd: And then we wanted to end the year at 51 million, which I think
we're pacing nicely, but I don't know what's going to happen.
14:03 - Michael Kianmahd: And that's 46% growth over 2023.
14:06 - Michael Kianmahd: Build out sales organization, which I think is delayed because I
don't want to do that until the ops are really dialed in.
14:16 - Michael Kianmahd: Establish and capitalize real estate strategy with our line of
credit.
14:18 - Michael Kianmahd: did.
14:20 - Michael Kianmahd: Best in class submission credit docs funding.
14:23 - Michael Kianmahd: Best in class team and collaboration.
14:29 - Laura: So.
14:30 - Michael Kianmahd: And then, yeah.
14:32 - Michael Kianmahd: Do you want to be more specific than that?
14:34 - Laura: Hang on a sec.
14:35 - Laura: I'm just like writing some notes and then I have questions if that's okay.
14:38 - Laura: Okay.
14:42 - Laura: Team plus, okay, so building out sales, what does that actually mean for you?
14:49 - Laura: It means like you want more feet, like you want more salespeople so that you
can.
14:54 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah, yeah, so like, let's say we deploy the updated models in the
industries of agriculture, construction and vocational.
15:05 - Michael Kianmahd: Yep.
15:06 - Michael Kianmahd: great coverage of truck dealerships, we don't have great cover-
age of construction equipment dealerships.
15:13 - Michael Kianmahd: And we don't want to only rely on brokers to find and send those
deals to us.
15:18 - Michael Kianmahd: So what my vision is for Dana and Fernando is to build sales
teams, like many sales teams under them in key regions.
15:52 - Michael Kianmahd: But then you open up the full suite of products to him.
15:54 - Michael Kianmahd: He could be a more effective salesperson and go get the
message.
15:58 - Michael Kianmahd: There's some synergy if he's calling on all the different types of
people, introducing the maxim brand to them, telling them how we can help them, diversify
their funding sources, that kind of thing.
16:09 - Michael Kianmahd: But obviously, it doesn't make sense to do that if their experience
is horrible because we don't have our ops dialed in.
16:16 - Michael Kianmahd: We're prioritizing ops, which is why these things are on the list.
16:23 - Michael Kianmahd: These things actually should have been first.
16:25 - Michael Kianmahd: I should have done that first.
16:27 - Laura: Yeah, okay.
16:28 - Laura: So that makes sense.
16:29 - Laura: Um, real estate strategy.
16:33 - Michael Kianmahd: So you can ignore that.
16:36 - Michael Kianmahd: Not relevant.
16:37 - Michael Kianmahd: It's relevant, but it's like, you know, it's not as relevant to you, I
think.
16:43 - Laura: So do you?
16:45 - Laura: Okay, so do you want to grow your real estate business?
16:48 - Laura: Like, is that part of the funding for your revenue?
16:52 - Laura: Or is there a specific real estate initiative?
16:59 - Michael Kianmahd: We have the ability to do real estate deals right now.
17:01 - Michael Kianmahd: But the real estate market is lumpy and not as scalable.
17:10 - Michael Kianmahd: What's the word?
17:12 - Laura: Stable?
17:14 - Michael Kianmahd: It's very like, man.
17:18 - Michael Kianmahd: Oh my God.
17:19 - Michael Kianmahd: I can't remember.
17:20 - Michael Kianmahd: It's like a one-off type of transaction.
17:23 - Michael Kianmahd: It's not like when you finance trucks, you can finance 1,000 of
them.
17:27 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah, Ok.
17:28 - Michael Kianmahd: It's not like a scale problem.
17:31 - Michael Kianmahd: It's all about the deal and the situation.
17:34 - Michael Kianmahd: And it's not as scalable.
17:36 - Michael Kianmahd: And it's harder to find them.
17:38 - Michael Kianmahd: And it's kind of more of like a kind of happenstance, if we get
lucky to see it.
17:45 - Michael Kianmahd: So we are capitalized adequately to do those at a smaller scale,
which is kind of our niche, but I wanna really build out the equipment piece of what we do.
17:54 - Laura: Okay, cool.
17:56 - Michael Kianmahd: That helps.
17:58 - Michael Kianmahd: Absolutely, and then this was like our, remember I talked about
feedback loops?
18:04 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah.
18:05 - Michael Kianmahd: So these are like the core departments at Maxim, and then
everything in the middle basically like allows the flywheel to turn.
18:12 - Michael Kianmahd: So you got credit, collections, and asset management.
18:17 - Michael Kianmahd: So credit can learn a lot from these two, collections can learn a
lot from these two, and asset management can learn from these two.
18:24 - Michael Kianmahd: So what we're doing is we're setting up recurring discussions.
18:28 - Michael Kianmahd: We'll like, Hubert will review all the charge-offs.
18:32 - Michael Kianmahd: Ricardo and Edbundo will be like, we keep having these issues
with these engine types.
18:37 - Michael Kianmahd: Don't finance these engine types anymore.
18:39 - Michael Kianmahd: Like, they're the biggest problems ever.
18:42 - Michael Kianmahd: So it's having all the departments kind of collaborate with each
other to help the business do better as a whole and learn from each other is like something
we're intentionally doing.
18:53 - Michael Kianmahd: And a lot of that, go ahead.
18:55 - Laura: Sorry, I was just gonna say, does that ultimately like prevent funding deals that
go sour?
19:01 - Laura: Like is the end goal to try and do that to just save time?
19:06 - Laura: Or is it actually to like fund better deals?
19:13 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah, so I'll give you some use cases.
19:14 - Michael Kianmahd: So we find out that there's a certain type of borrower that is
slipping through our model decisioning, but has a really high failure rate because of the truck
type being purchased.
19:30 - Michael Kianmahd: Right, yeah.
19:31 - Michael Kianmahd: And then we might create a rule and say, do not finance this type
of truck, it's a shitty truck.
19:36 - Michael Kianmahd: It's not built well, it's a big problem, And we don't learn about that
until we fund it.
19:44 - Michael Kianmahd: It breaks down.
19:46 - Michael Kianmahd: Keybrite's team deals with it.
19:48 - Michael Kianmahd: They repo it, or they realize it's broken down at a shop some-
where, and then we basically have to walk away from it, which is an asset management
issue.
19:55 - Michael Kianmahd: And then we talk about it as a team, and we're like, why did this
happen?
19:57 - Michael Kianmahd: Oh, it happened because of this.
19:58 - Michael Kianmahd: Wait, how many times did that happen?
20:00 - Michael Kianmahd: Is that unique to that one deal, or does that happen at a really
high rate for this brand and engine type or transmission type?
20:06 - Michael Kianmahd: And then we'll say, you know what?
20:07 - Michael Kianmahd: We're not doing that anymore.
20:09 - Michael Kianmahd: Gotcha.
20:10 - Michael Kianmahd: That we can kind of stop the problem from growing.
20:13 - Michael Kianmahd: Okay.
20:13 - Michael Kianmahd: That's one example.
20:14 - Michael Kianmahd: Another example is, you know, we'll look back at our referral
partners and we'll see if any of our referral partners have a really high default rate.
20:23 - Michael Kianmahd: And then we'll just be like, hmm, for whatever reason, Texas Truck
Sales has a oddly high default rate.
20:31 - Michael Kianmahd: I wonder if they're like, you know, not really doing the proper
maintenance before they sell their vehicles, when they buy them at auctions from other
trucking companies.
20:41 - Michael Kianmahd: Perhaps they underinvest in their trucks before we buy them and
then our customers get burned with it and then we get burned with it because our customers
basically can't afford to keep them.
20:48 - Michael Kianmahd: Spiky Scribe, Michael Kianmahd, Cory Gambello, Laura, Spiky
Scribe, Michael Kianmahd, Cory
21:18 - Michael Kianmahd: that actually hurt his credit.
21:22 - Michael Kianmahd: So the credit before he took the money out of his credit cards
was great and then it crashed and then when he had an issue he had no cash available
because he dumped it all in the down payment.
21:33 - Michael Kianmahd: We should probably underwrite that a little bit more carefully.
21:37 - Michael Kianmahd: Okay.
21:38 - Michael Kianmahd: And it's a bit more of like idiosyncratic kind of borrower level kind
of thought provoking thing that we might leverage Kent to help us figure out.
21:51 - Laura: Yeah.
21:52 - Laura: It's like learning from the data.
21:54 - Michael Kianmahd: Exactly.
21:55 - Michael Kianmahd: But it's like it's like it goes from like anecdotal like there's an
anecdotal warning sign to like what does the data tell us about this?
22:03 - Michael Kianmahd: Like let's look at every example that fits his profile.
22:05 - Laura: Gotcha.
22:06 - Laura: Yeah.
22:08 - Laura: Okay, two more questions on this.
22:10 - Laura: So just going back, best of class submission through to funding, best in class.
22:15 - Laura: What does best in class actually mean for you?
22:19 - Michael Kianmahd: I'll send you some stuff to read, but it's probably like a two-hour
credit decisioning.
22:35 - Michael Kianmahd: So like from it from like deal submitted to I got a credit decision
is two hours or less.
22:42 - Michael Kianmahd: Two hours or less.
22:44 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah.
22:45 - Michael Kianmahd: Same day docs and funding capability.
22:50 - Laura: Same day.
22:51 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah.
22:52 - Michael Kianmahd: Which would mean the ability to do e-notaries because that
delays the process and get a Gps unit installed the same day and you know.
23:01 - Michael Kianmahd: Okay.
23:01 - Michael Kianmahd: Heavy lifting.
23:02 - Michael Kianmahd: This is for equipment deals, I should say, not for real estate.
23:08 - Laura: That's not applicable, right?
23:09 - Michael Kianmahd: Because real estate deals are like...
23:10 - Michael Kianmahd: Real estate, yeah, because you have to open title and get title
insurance and...
23:15 - Michael Kianmahd: As frictionless as possible.
23:20 - Laura: Yeah.
23:22 - Laura: Okay.
23:23 - Laura: So, two hours from application through to credit decision, within 24 hours,
docs and funding.
23:31 - Laura: That's like from docs out to funding?
23:37 - Michael Kianmahd: Like doc generation, docs out.
23:41 - Michael Kianmahd: Okay, docs request.
23:42 - Michael Kianmahd: Spending dollars funded.
23:45 - Laura: Yeah, okay.
23:47 - Michael Kianmahd: And then, you know, the best in class credit is related to being
able to assess risk.
23:57 - Michael Kianmahd: price it, the pricing being competitive.
24:01 - Michael Kianmahd: So we make deals.
24:03 - Michael Kianmahd: If we're not competitive, it's because it's a bad deal and we're not
gonna make money.
24:10 - Michael Kianmahd: So there's like, you know, like when you broker a deal, you don't
own the risk after the deal closes.
24:17 - Michael Kianmahd: Bank owns the risk.
24:20 - Michael Kianmahd: So we have to be conscious of making sure
24:22 - Michael Kianmahd: the referral partner is fairly compensated
24:25 - Michael Kianmahd: making sure the deal makes sense for the borrower
24:27 - Michael Kianmahd: the borrower has a reasonable chance of success
24:30 - Michael Kianmahd: and that we price the deal on average high enough
24:33 - Michael Kianmahd: so our funding costs are covered
24:35 - Michael Kianmahd: our operational costs are covered
24:38 - Michael Kianmahd: the deals that go bad get paid for by the deals that go well
24:42 - Michael Kianmahd: because the rate is high enough to offset the losers.
24:46 - Michael Kianmahd: There's math related to that.
24:48 - Michael Kianmahd: So we're just validating the math is correct, which is what I mean
by credit.
24:58 - Laura: So you have an actual measure, like you can actually measure that.
25:01 - Michael Kianmahd: Yeah, so that deal structuring tool and the scoring model are
intended to help us measure that at scale with data backing up the way the math works.
25:17 - Michael Kianmahd: Okay.
25:17 - Michael Kianmahd: Would you like me to show you?
25:19 - Laura: No, that's okay.
25:20 - Laura: I'm visualizing it right now.
25:21 - Laura: That's when I look like that.
25:22 - Laura: Okay.
25:24 - Laura: Yeah, that, okay, that makes sense.
25:27 - Laura: Yeah.
25:29 - Laura: Will the industry stuff help you improve that?
25:34 - Michael Kianmahd: It will, yeah, in a few ways, because each industry has its own
dynamics.
25:41 - Michael Kianmahd: I take like a homogenous population and all they do is trucking,
I'll probably get slightly more insight from that data set
25:54 - Michael Kianmahd: than looking at, you know, non-trucking deals, combine them
with trucking deals, and then also combine them with real estate credit.
26:05 - Michael Kianmahd: Like, obviously, the data will be a lot noisier.
26:09 - Michael Kianmahd: There probably is some correlation, like there's a credit cycle, and
you know, rising boat lifts all tides, and when the tide goes out, it goes out for everybody, but
there are some industries that are more or less resilient.
26:22 - Michael Kianmahd: Trucking is less resilient.
26:27 - Michael Kianmahd: Agriculture is more resilient.
26:29 - Michael Kianmahd: You can't like stop eating food, although it's subjective to
commodity prices.
26:35 - Michael Kianmahd: Real estate has higher resiliency, but it's so volatile.
26:38 - Michael Kianmahd: So it basically comes down to like how low your Ltv is in bad
times.
26:45 - Laura: So when you say best in class credit, if I ask you in December of 2025, have
you reached best in class credit?
26:55 - Laura: How do you actually say yes or no or track a measurable, where you are today
versus where you are?
27:04 - Michael Kianmahd: Is that an actual measurable thing?
27:06 - Michael Kianmahd: That's a fantastic question.
27:08 - Michael Kianmahd: I have to show you what that looks like.
27:10 - Laura: Okay, so we'll park that one, I think, for a different time because we've got Ai
coming out.
27:15 - Laura: But that's really what I'm looking for
27:17 - Laura: is where, so where I can say to you, like, okay, you had a goal
27:21 - Laura: where you the two hours or less on like a credit decision is a
27:25 - Laura: really good example of like a goal that I can use because then
27:29 - Laura: I can tie all of your like requests and Salesforce to that
27:33 - Laura: and say, we're going to not do this because it doesn't actually
27:37 - Laura: like help get us there.
27:39 - Laura: But we've done and they like we can show them how we've done that and then
how they've helped or hindered those goals?
27:48 - Michael Kianmahd: The way I would define it is the deals that we underwrite default
at the rate we expect or less.
27:59 - Michael Kianmahd: And we feel like we fairly priced deals in retrospect.
28:03 - Michael Kianmahd: So we'll go out and we'll fund$40 million this year.
28:06 - Michael Kianmahd: And if that$40 million on average, has a default rate of under 17%
and we make the money we think we're going to make
28:23 - Michael Kianmahd: that would suggest that we're doing a good job underwriting.
28:26 - Laura: Okay.
28:27 - Laura: Yeah.
28:27 - Michael Kianmahd: I think that makes sense.
28:28 - Michael Kianmahd: If we're too conservative and we fund less than we want and
we're losing deals to people that have a lot less skill and we think they're actually funding
good deals that we would love to fund, there's probably something wrong with the math.
28:47 - Michael Kianmahd: That would not be best in class.
28:49 - Michael Kianmahd: In the real world, if we're funding deals and we're actually buying
higher risks and
28:57 - Michael Kianmahd: that ends up costing us a lot and we make a lot less money than
we expected because
29:01 - Michael Kianmahd: defaults are higher and losses were higher when those deals
matured, that would not be
29:05 - Michael Kianmahd: invest in class.
29:07 - Laura: Okay, yeah.
29:08 - Laura: I think I've got a good idea on that one.
29:12 - Laura: I'll come back to you if I wanna go through the pricing stuff again.
29:15 - Laura: Well, sorry, we will go through it again at some point, but that gives me enough
to go off of for now.
29:21 - Laura: We can park the dupe stuff for today.
29:23 - Laura: And then just a data model, I'm just bugging Charles and waiting for him to
give me the rest of the examples.
29:29 - Laura: I've made the changes if he does it today, I should be able to give you a video.
29:33 - Laura: If not, I'll give you a new data model video tomorrow, and then we can kind of
go from there.
29:38 - Michael Kianmahd: Sounds great.
29:39 - Laura: Thank you, guys.
29:40 - Laura: All right, thank you.
29:41 - Laura: I'm going to jump on with the Aio team.
29:43 - Laura: Stay tuned.
29:45 - Laura: I'll let you know how that goes.
29:46 - Michael Kianmahd: Sounds great.
29:47 - Laura: Thanks.
29:48 - Michael Kianmahd: Ok, thanks, guys.
29:48 - Michael Kianmahd: Thanks, guys.
29:48 - Michael Kianmahd: See you later.
